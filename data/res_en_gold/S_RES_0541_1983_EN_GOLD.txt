Resolution 541 (1983)
of 18 November 1983

The Security Council,

Having heard the statement of the Foreign Minister
of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, 58

Concerned at the declaration by the Turkish Cypriot
authorities issued on 15 November 198359 which
purports to create an independent State in northern
Cyprus,

Considering that this declaration is incompatible
with the 1960 Treaty concerning the establishment of
the Republic of Cyprus 60 and the 1960 Treaty of
Guarantee, 61

Considering, therefore, that the attempt to create
a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" is invalid,
and will contribute to a worsening of the situation in
Cyprus,

Reaffirming its resolutions 365 (1974) and 367
(1975),

Aware of the need for a solution of the Cyprus
problem based on the mission of good offices undertaken by the Secretary-General,

Affirming its continuing support for the United
Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus,

Taking note of the Secretary-Generalâ€™s statement of
17 November 1983, 58

1. Deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot
authorities of the purported secession of part of the
Republic of Cyprus;

2. Considers the declaration referred to above as
legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal;

3. Calls for the urgent and effective implementation of its resolutions 365 (1974) and 367 (1975);

4. Requests the Secretary-General to pursue his
mission of good offices, in order to achieve the earliest
possible progress towards a just and lasting settlement
in Cyprus;

5. Calls upon the parties to co-operate fully with
the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices;

6. Calls upon all States to respect the sovereignty,
independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment
of the Republic of Cyprus;

7. Calls upon all States not to recognize any
Cypriot State other than the Republic of Cyprus;

8. Calls upon all States and the two communities
in Cyprus to refrain from any action which might
exacerbate the situation;

Security Council fully informed.
