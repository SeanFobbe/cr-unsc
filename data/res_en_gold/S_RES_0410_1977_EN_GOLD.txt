Resolution 410 (1977)
of 15 June 1977

The Security Council,

Noting from the report of the Secretary-General
of 7 June 1977 55 that in existing circumstances the
presence of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in
Cyprus is essential not only to help maintain quiet in
the island but also to facilitate the continued search
for a peaceful settlement,

Noting from the report the conditions prevailing in
the island,

Noting also from the report that the freedom of
movement of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force
in Cyprus and its civil police is still restricted in the
north of the island, and expressing the hope that ways
will be found to surmount the remaining obstacles,

Noting further that the Secretary-General expressed
the view that the best hope of achieving a just and
lasting settlement of the Cyprus problem lies in negotiations between the representatives of the two communities and that the usefulness of those negotiations
depends upon the willingness of all parties concerned
to show the necessary flexibilily, taking into account
not only their own interests but also the legitimate
aspirations and requirements of the opposing side,

Noting that, owing to the efforts of the Secretary-General, his staff and the United Nations Peace-keeping
Force, and with the co-operation of the parties, there
has been a relative improvement in the security situation, but that this evolution has yet to relieve the
underlying tensions in the island,

Noting also the report of the Secretary-General of
30 April 1977 56 concerning the high-level meeting
under the auspices of the Secretary-General, and emphasizing the need to adhere to the agreement reached
at this meeting as well as to the agreements reached
at the previous rounds of the talks,

Noting further the concurrence of the parties concerned in the recommendation by the Secretary-General
that the Security Council extend the stationing of the
United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus for a
further period of six months,

Noting that the Government of Cyprus has agreed
that, in view of the prevailing conditions in the island,
it is necessary to keep the Force in Cyprus beyond
15 June 1977,

3. Urges the parties concerned to act with the utmost restraint by refraining from any unilateral o1

the United Nations Peace-keeping Force, established

final solution will make possible a withdrawal or substantial reduction of the Force;

effectively,
