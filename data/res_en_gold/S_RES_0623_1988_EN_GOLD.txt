Resolution 623 (1988)
of 23 November 1988

The Security Council,

Having learned with grave concern of the intention of the
South African authorities to implement the death sentence
imposed on Mr. Paul Tefo Setlaba, an anti-apartheid
activist, on the basis of so-called “common purpose”,

Strongly urges the Government of South Africa to stay
execution and commute the death sentence imposed on Mr.
Paul Tefo Setlaba in order to avoid further aggravating the
situation in South Africa.

Adopted at the 2830th meeting by
13 votes to none, with 2 abstentions (United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and
United States of America).
