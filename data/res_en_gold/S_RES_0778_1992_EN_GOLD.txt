of 26 August 1992

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991, and
in particular paragraphs 2 to 4 thereof, and its resolution 689
(1991) of 9 April 1991,

Recalling the report of the Secretary-General of 2 May
1991 relative to paragraph 3 of Security Council resolution 687
(1991), 234 concerning the establishment of the United Nations
Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission and the

Having considered the Secretary-General’s letter of 12
August 1992 to the President of the Security Council transmitting the further report of the Commission,

Recalling in this connection that through the demarcation
process the Commission is not reallocating territory between
Iraq and Kuwait but is simply carrying out the technical task
necessary to demarcate for the first time the precise coordinates
of the boundary set out in the "Agreed Minutes between the
State of Kuwait and the Republic of Iraq regarding the
restoration of friendly relations, recognition and related
matters” signed by them on 4 October 1963, and that this task
is being carried out in the special circumstances following Iraq’s
invasion of Kuwait and pursuant to resolution 687 (1991) and
the Secretary-General’s report on the implementation of
paragraph 3 that resolution,

1. Welcomes the Secretary-General’s letter of 12 August
1992 to the President of the Security Council and the further
report of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission enclosed therewith;

2. Expresses its appreciation to the Commission for its
work on the demarcation of the land boundary, and welcomes
its demarcation decisions;

3. Welcomes also the decision of the Commission to
consider the eastern section of the boundary, which includes the
offshore boundary, at its next session and urges it to demarcate
this part of the boundary as soon as possible and thus complete
its work;

4. Underlines its guarantee of the inviolability of the
above-mentioned international boundary and its decision to
take as appropriate all necessary measures to that end in
accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, as provided
for in paragraph 4 of resolution 687 (1991);

5. Welcomes further the Secretary-General’s intention to
carry out at the earliest practicable time the realignment of the
demilitarized zone referred to in paragraph 5 of resolution 687
(1991) to correspond to the international boundary demarcated
by the Commission, with the consequent removal of the Iraqi
police posts;

6. Urges the two States concerned to cooperate fully with
the work of the Commission;

Decides to remain seized of the matter.
