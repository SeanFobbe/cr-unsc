of 4 October 1993

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 743 (1992) of 21 February 1992 and all
subsequent resolutions relating to the United Nations Protection Force,

Reaffirming also its resolution 713 (1991) of 25 September 1991
and all subsequent relevant resolutions,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 20
September 1993, 95

Having also considered the letter of the Minister for Foreign Affairs
of the Republic of Croatia dated 24 September 1993, 96

Deeply concerned that the United Nations peace-keeping plan for
the Republic of Croatia 64, and all relevant Council resolutions, in
particular resolution 769 (1992) of 7 August 1992, have not yet been
fully implemented,

Reiterating its determination to ensure the security of the Force and
its freedom of movement for all its missions, and to these ends, as
regards the Force in the Republic of Croatia and in the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the
United Nations,

1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General of 20 September
1993, in particular paragraph 16 thereof;

2. Notes the intention of the Secretary-General to establish, as
described in his report, three subordinate commands within the United
Nations Protection Force - UNPROFOR (Croatia), UNPROFOR
(Bosnia and Herzegovina) and UNPROFOR (the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia) - while retaining the existing dispositions in all
other respects for the direction and conduct of the United Nations
operation in the territory of the former Yugoslavia;

3. Condemns once again continuing military attacks within the
territory of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and reaffirms its commitment to ensure respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Croatia, of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where the
Force is deployed;

4. Reaffirms the crucial importance of the full and prompt implementation of the United Nations peace-keeping plan for the Republic of
Croatia, including the provisions of the plan concerning the demilitarization of the United Nations Protected Areas, and calls upon the
signatories of that plan and all others concerned, in particular the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), to cooperate
in its full implementation,

5. Declares that continued non-cooperation in the implementation
of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council or external interference, in respect of the full implementation of the United Nations peace-
keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia, would have serious consequences, and in this connection affirms that full normalization of the
international community's position towards those concerned will take
into account their actions in implementing all relevant Council
resolutions, including those relating to the peace-keeping plan for
Croatia;

6.Calls for an immediate cease-fire agreement between the
Government of Croatia and the local Serb authorities in the Protected
Areas, mediated under the auspices of the International Conference on
the Former Yugoslavia, and urges them to cooperate fully and
unconditionally in its implementation, as well as in the implementation
of all the relevant Council resolutions;

7. Stresses the importance it attaches, as a first step towards the
implementation of the United Nations peace-keeping plan for the
Republic of Croatia, to the process of restoration of the authority of the
Republic of Croatia in the pink zones, and in this context calls for the
revival of the Joint Commission established under the chairmanship of
the United Nations Protection Force;

8. Urges all the parties and others concerned to cooperate with the
Force in reaching and implementing an agreement on confidence-
building measures including the restoration of electricity, water and
communications in all regions of Croatia, and stresses in this context
the importance it attaches to the opening of the railroad between Zagreb
and Split, the highway between Zagreb and Zupanja, and the Adriatic
oil pipeline, securing the uninterrupted traffic across the Maslenica
strait, and restoring the supply of electricity and water to all regions of
Croatia including the Protected Areas,

9. Authorizes the Force, in carrying out its mandate in Croatia, acting
in self-defence, to take the necessary measures, including the use of
force, to ensure its security and its freedom of movement,

10. Decides to continue to review urgently the extension of close
air support to the Force in the territory of Croatia as recommended by
the Secretary-General in his report of 20 September 1993; 95

11. Decides in this context to extend the mandate of the Force
for an additional period terminating on 31 March 1994;

12. Requests the Secretary-General to report two months after
the adoption of the present resolution on progress towards implementa-
tion of the United Nations peace-keeping plan for the Republic of
Croatia and all relevant Security Council resolutions, taking into
account the position of the Croatian Government, as well as on the
outcome of the negotiations within the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia, and decides to reconsider the mandate of the Force
in the light of that report;

13. Also requests the Secretary-General to keep the Council
regularly informed on developments in regard to the implementation of
the Force's mandate,

14. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.

Adopted unanimously at the 3286th meeting.
