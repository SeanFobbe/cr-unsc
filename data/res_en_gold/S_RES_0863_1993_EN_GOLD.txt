Commending also the role played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
through the Special Representative of its Secretary-General, in the
implementation of the General Peace Agreement,

peace process, especially the direct talks in Maputo between the President of
Mozambique, Mr. Joaquim Chissano, and Mr. Alfonso Dhlakama, President of the
Resist6Ã©ncia Nacional Mogambicana (RENAMO), which led to the agreements signed on

of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), and the progress made in
the establishment by ONUMOZ of assembly areas,

more time or further concessions,

the parties to cooperate fully with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in this regard;

process of assembly and demobilization of troops, and its continuation, in
