RESOLUTION 831 (1993)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3222nd meeting,
on 27 May 1993

The Security Council,

Recalling its resolution 186 (1964) and subsequent relevant resolutions,

Reaffirming that the extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) should be considered every six months,

Noting the recent communication from the Government of Cyprus to the
Secretary-General (S/25647**),

Noting that both voluntary and assessed methods of contribution are
acceptable for United Nations peace-keeping operations and stressing the
importance of maximizing voluntary contributions,

Stressing the importance it attaches to the achievement of early progress
towards a political settlement in Cyprus, and also to the implementation of
confidence-building measures,

Reiterating in particular its call to both sides to cooperate with UNFICYP
in order to extend the unmanning agreement of 1989 to all areas of the United
Nations-controlled Buffer Zone where the two sides are in close proximity to
each other,

Reaffirming that the present status quo is not acceptable, and concerned
that the United Nations should not be entering into open-ended peace-keeping
commitments,

1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations
operation in Cyprus (S/25492);

2. Expresses its appreciation for past voluntary contributions to UNFICYP
and for those that have recently been offered for the future, which are
essential for the continuation of the Force;

3. Stresses the importance of the continuation of voluntary contributions
to the Force and calls for maximum voluntary contributions in the future;

4. Decides that, with effect from the next extension of UNFICYP's mandate
on or before 15 June 1993, those costs of the Force which are not covered by
voluntary contributions should be treated as expenses of the Organization under
Article 17 (2) of the Charter of the United Nations;

5. Decides also that UNFICYP should be restructured as a first step on
the basis of the proposal in paragraphs 16-19 of the Secretary-General's report
(S/25492), with the addition of a limited number of observers for reconnaissance
and with a view to further restructuring in the light of the reassessment
referred to in paragraph 7 below;

6. Underlines the responsibility of the parties for minimizing tension
and facilitating the operation of UNFICYP, including through the implementation
of confidence-building measures, including that the number of foreign troops in
the Republic of Cyprus undergo a significant reduction and that a reduction of
defence spending be effected in the Republic of Cyprus, as envisaged in its
earlier relevant resolutions;

7. Decides to conduct a comprehensive reassessment of UNFICYP at the time
of the consideration of the Force's mandate in December 1993, including of the
implications of progress on confidence-building measures and towards a political
settlement for the future of the Force;

8. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report one month before
that reassessment, to cover all aspects of the situation, including
confidence-building measures, progress in political negotiations and possible
progressive steps towards an observer force based on the proposal described in
paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General's report (S$/25492);

9. Invites the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps to implement
this resolution.
