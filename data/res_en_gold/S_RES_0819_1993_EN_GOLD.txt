RESOLUTION 819 (1993)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3199th meeting,
on 16 April 1993

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 713 (1991) of 25 September 1991 and all its
subsequent relevant resolutions,

Taking note that the International Court of Justice in its Order of
8 April 1993 in the case concerning application of the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)) unanimously indicated as a provisional
measure that the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) should immediately, in pursuance of its undertaking in the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of
9 December 1948, take all measures within its power to prevent the commission
of the crime of genocide,

Reaffirming the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political
independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Reaffirming its call on the parties and others concerned to observe
immediately the cease-fire throughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Reaffirming its condemnation of all violations of international
humanitarian law, including, in particular, the practice of “ethnic cleansing",

Concerned by the pattern of hostilities by Bosnian Serb paramilitary
units against towns and villages in eastern Bosnia and in this regard
reaffirming that any taking or acquisition of territory by the threat or use
of force, including through the practice of "ethnic cleansing", is unlawful
and unacceptable,

Deeply alarmed at the information provided by the Secretary-General to
the Security Council on 16 April 1993 on the rapid deterioration of the
situation in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas, as a result of the
continued deliberate armed attacks and shelling of the innocent civilian
population by Bosnian Serb paramilitary units,

Strongly condemning the deliberate interdiction by Bosnian Serb
paramilitary units of humanitarian assistance convoys,

Also strongly condemning the actions taken by Bosnian Serb paramilitary
units against UNPROFOR, in particular, their refusal to guarantee the safety
and freedom of movement of UNPROFOR personnel,

Aware that a tragic humanitarian emergency has already developed in
Srebrenica and its surrounding areas as a direct consequence of the brutal
actions of Bosnian Serb paramilitary units, forcing the large-scale
displacement of civilians, in particular women, children and the elderly,

Recalling the provisions of resolution 815 (1993) on the mandate of
UNPROFOR and in that context acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the
United Nations,

1. Demands that all parties and others concerned treat Srebrenica and
its surroundings as a safe area which should be free from any armed attack or
any other hostile act;

2. Demands also to that effect the immediate cessation of armed attacks
by Bosnian Serb paramilitary units against Srebrenica and their immediate
withdrawal from the areas surrounding Srebrenica;

3. Demands that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) immediately cease the supply of military arms, equipment and
services to the Bosnian Serb paramilitary units in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina;

4. Requests the Secretary-General, with a view to monitoring the
humanitarian situation in the safe area, to take immediate steps to increase
the presence of UNPROFOR in Srebrenica and its surroundings; demands that all
parties and others concerned cooperate fully and promptly with UNPROFOR
towards that end; and requests the Secretary-General to report urgently
thereon to the Security Council;

5. Reaffirms that any taking or acquisition of territory by the threat
or use of force, including through the practice of "ethnic cleansing", is
unlawful and unacceptable;

6. Condemns and rejects the deliberate actions of the Bosnian Serb
party to force the evacuation of the civilian population from Srebrenica and
its surrounding areas as well as from other parts of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina as part of its overall abhorrent campaign of “ethnic
cleansing";

7. Reaffirms its condemnation of all violations of international
humanitarian law, in particular the practice of "ethnic cleansing" and
reaffirms that those who commit or order the commission of such acts shall be
held individually responsible in respect of such acts;

8. Demands the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to all
parts of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular to the civilian
population of Srebrenica and its surrounding areas and recalls that such
impediments to the delivery of humanitarian assistance constitute a serious
violation of international humanitarian law;

9. Urges the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees to use all the resources at their disposal within the scope of
the relevant resolutions of the Council to reinforce the existing humanitarian
operations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular Srebrenica
and its surroundings;

10. Further demands that all parties guarantee the safety and full
freedom of movement of UNPROFOR and of all other United Nations personnel as
well as members of humanitarian organizations;

11. Further requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with UNHCR
and UNPROFOR, to arrange for the safe transfer of the wounded and ill
civilians from Srebrenica and its surrounding areas and to urgently report
thereon to the Council;

12. Decides to send, as soon as possible, a mission of members of the
Security Council to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to ascertain the
situation and report thereon to the Security Council;

13. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter and to consider
further steps to achieve a solution in conformity with relevant resolutions of
the Council.
