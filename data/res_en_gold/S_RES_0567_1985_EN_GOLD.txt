prevention and removal of all threats to international
peace and security posed by South Africa’s military attacks;

of aggression against the territory of Angola in the Province of Cabinda as well as for its renewed intensified,
premeditated and unprovoked acts of aggression, which
constitute a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country and seriously endanger
international peace and security;

utilization of the international Territory of Namibia as a
springboard for perpetrating its armed attacks as well as
sustaining its occupation of parts of the territory of
Angola;

3. Demands that South Africa should unconditionally withdraw forthwith all its occupation forces
from the territory of Angola, cease all acts of aggression
against that State and scrupulously respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People’s
Republic of Angola;

4. Considers that Angola is entitled to appropriate
redress and compensation for any material damage it
has suffered;

5. Requests the Secretary-General to monitor the
implementation of the present resolution and report to
