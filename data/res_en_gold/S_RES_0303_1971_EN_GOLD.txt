The Security Council,

Having considered the item on the agenda of its
1606th meeting, as contained in document S/Agenda/1606 52

twenty-sixth session, as provided for in Assembly resolution 377 A (V) of 3 November 1950.

Adopted at the 1608th meeting by 11 votes to none,

Socialist Republics, United
Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland).
