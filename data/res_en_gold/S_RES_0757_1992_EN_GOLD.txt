Resolution 757 (1992)
of 30 May 1992 54

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolutions 713 (1991) of 25 September
1991, 721 (1991) of 27 November 1991, 724 (1991) of 15
December 1991, 727 (1992) of 8 January 1992, 740 (1992) of 7
February 1992, 743 (1992) of 21 February 1992, 749 (1992) of
7 April 1992 and 752 (1992) of 15 May 1992,

Noting that in the very complex context of events in the
former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia all parties bear
some responsibility for the situation,

Reaffirming its support for the Conference on Yugoslavia,
including the efforts undertaken by the European Community
in the framework of the discussions on constitutional arrangements for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and recalling that no
territorial gains or changes brought about by violence are
acceptable and that the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina are
inviolable.

Deploring the fact that the demands in resolution 752
(1992) have not been complied with, including its demands that:

- All parties and others concerned in Bosnia and
Herzegovina stop the fighting immediately,

- All forms of interference from outside Bosnia and
Herzegovina cease immediately,

- Bosnia and Herzegovina’s neighbours take swift action
to end all interference and respect the territorial
integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

- Action be taken as regards units of the Yugoslav
People’s Army in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including
the disbanding and disarming with weapons placed
under effective international monitoring of any units
that are neither withdrawn nor placed under the
authority of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

- All irregular forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina be
disbanded and disarmed,

Deploring also that its call for the immediate cessation of
forcible expulsions and attempts to change the ethnic composition of the population has not been heeded, and reaffirming in
this context the need for the effective protection of human
rights and fundamental freedoms, including those of ethnic
minorities,

Dismayed that conditions have not yet been established for
the effective and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance, including safe and secure access to and from Sarajevo and
other airports in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Deeply concerned that those United Nations Protection
Force personnel remaining in Sarajevo have been subjected to
deliberate mortar and small-arms fire, and that the United
Nations Military Observers deployed in the Mostar region have
had to be withdrawn,

Deeply concerned also at developments in Croatia, including
persistent cease-fire violations and the continued expulsion of
non-Serb civilians, and at the obstruction of and lack of
cooperation with the Force in other parts of Croatia,

Deploring the tragic incident on 18 May 1992 which caused
the death of a member of the International Committee of the
Red Cross team in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Noting that the claim by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to continue automatically the
membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in the United Nations has not been generally
accepted,

Expressing its appreciation for the report of the Secretary-General of 26 May 1992° submitted pursuant to Security
Council resolution 752 (1992),

Recalling its primary responsibility under the Charter of the
United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and
security,

Recalling also the provisions of Chapter VIII of the
Charter, and the continuing role that the European Community
is playing in working for a peaceful solution in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, as well as in other republics of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,

Recalling further its decision in resolution 752 (1992) to
consider further steps to achieve a peaceful solution in conformity with its relevant resolutions, and affirming its determination to take measures against any party or parties which fail
to fulfil the requirements of resolution 752 (1992) and its other
relevant resolutions,

Determined in this context to adopt certain measures with
the sole objective of achieving a peaceful solution and encouraging the efforts undertaken by the European Community and
its member States,

Recalling the right of States, under Article 50 of the
Charter, to consult the Council where they find themselves
confronted with special economic problems arising from the
carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures,

Determining that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
and in other parts of the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia constitutes a threat to international peace and
security,
