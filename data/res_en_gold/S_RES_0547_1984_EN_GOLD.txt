Resolution 547 (1984)
of 13 January 1984

The Security Council,

Having considered the question of the death
sentence passed on 6 June 1983 in South Africa on
Mr. Malesela Benjamin Maloise,

Recalling its resolutions 503 (1982), 525 (1982) and
533 (1983),

Gravely concerned over the current decision of the
South African authorities to reject an appeal against
the death sentence imposed upon Mr. Maloise,

Conscious that carrying out the death sentence will
further aggravate the situation in South Africa,

1. Calls upon the South African authorities
to commute the death sentence imposed upon
Mr. Maloise;

2. Urges all States and organizations to use their
influence and to take urgent measures, in accordance
with the Charter of the United Nations, the resolutions of the Security Council and relevant international instruments, to save the life of Mr. Malesela
Benjamin Maloise.

Adopted unanimously at the
2512th meeting.
