Convinced of the need to ensure equitable distribution of
humanitarian relief assistance to all segments of the Iraqi
civilian population through effective monitoring and transparency of the process,

Recalling and reaffirming in this regard its resolution 688

importance of the Memorandum of Understanding between the

(1991) and 699 (1991), Iraq is required to pay the full costs of
the Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy
Agency in carrying out the tasks authorized by section C of
resolution 687 (1991), and that the Secretary-General, in the
report of 15 July 1991 that he submitted to the Council
pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 699 (1991), 92 expressed

the sale of some Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products;

the United Nations Compensation Fund and half the costs of
the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission; and
recalling further that, in its resolutions 686 (1991) and 687
