Adopted by the Security Council at its 3114th meeting,
on 14 September 1992

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 743 (1992) of 21 February 1992 and all
subsequent resolutions relating to the United Nations Protection Force
(UNPROFOR),

Expressing its full support for the Statement of Principles adopted and
other agreements reached at the London Conference, including the agreement of
the parties to the conflict to collaborate fully in the delivery of
humanitarian relief by road throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Having examined the report of the Secretary-General of 10 September 1992
(S/24540),

Noting with appreciation the offers made by a number of States, following
the adoption of its resolution 770 (1992) of 13 August 1992, to make available
military personnel to facilitate the delivery by relevant United Nations
humanitarian organizations and others of humanitarian assistance to Sarajevo
and wherever needed in other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, such personnel
to be made available to the United Nations without cost to the Organization,

Reaffirming its determination to ensure the protection and security of
UNPROFOR and United Nations personnel,

Stressing in this context the importance of air measures, such as the ban
on military flights to which all parties to the London Conference committed
themselves, whose rapid implementation could, inter alia, reinforce the
security of humanitarian activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

2. Authorizes, in implementation of paragraph 2 of resolution 770 (1992),
the enlargements of UNPROFOR's mandate and strength in Bosnia and Herzegovina
recommended by the Secretary-General in that report to perform the functions
outlined in the report, including the protection of convoys of released detainees
if requested by the International Committee of the Red Cross;

3. Further urges Member States, nationally or through regional agencies or
arrangements, to provide the Secretary-General with such financial or other
assistance as he deems appropriate to assist in the performance of the functions
outlined in his report;

4. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter in particular with a view
to considering, as required, what further steps might be necessary to ensure
UNPROFOR's security and to enable it to fulfil its mandate.
