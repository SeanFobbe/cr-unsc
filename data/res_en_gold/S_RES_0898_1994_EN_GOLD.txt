RESOLUTION 898 (1994)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3338th meeting,
on 23 February 1994

 

 

The Security Council,

 

Reaffirming its resolution 782 (1992) of 13 October 1992 and all subsequent
resolutions,

Having considered the report of the Secretary—General on the United Nations
Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) dated 28 January 1994 (S/1994/89 and
Add.1 and 2), and having completed the review of the status of ONUMOZ called for
in its resolution 882 (1993),

 

 

Commending the efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special Representative
and the personnel of ONUMOZ in seeking to implement fully the mandate entrusted
to it,

Commending also the role played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
through the Special Representative of its Secretary-General, in the
implementation of the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique (S/24635, annex),

 

Reiterating the importance it attaches to the General Peace Agreement, and
to the timely fulfilment in good faith by all parties of their obligations under
the Agreement,

Noting that the people of Mozambique bear the ultimate responsibility for
the successful implementation of the General Peace Agreement,

Welcoming recent positive developments in the implementation of the General
Peace Agreement, but concerned none the less at delays in its full
implementation,

Taking note of the request by the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO
concerning the monitoring of all police activities and additional tasks set out
in the agreements of 3 September 1993 (S/26432), and of the agreement of both
parties to the general concept for the ONUMOZ police contingent,

Stressing the necessity, in this as in other peace-keeping operations, to
continue to monitor expenditures carefully during this period of increasing
demands on peace-keeping resources, without jeopardizing their purposes,

Noting with appreciation in this context that the Secretary-General, in
proposing the establishment of a police component as an integral part of ONUMOZ,
has at the same time stated his intention to present specific proposals for the
phased reduction of the military component of ONUMOZ, without prejudice to the
effective discharge of its mandate, in particular the tasks of its military
component,

Reaffirming its conviction that the resolution of the conflict in
Mozambique will contribute to peace and security,

1. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General of 28 January 1994;

2. Authorizes the establishment of a United Nations police component of
up to 1,144 personnel as an integral part of ONUMOZ with the mandate and
deployment described in paragraphs 9 to 18 of document S/1994/89/Add.1;

3. Requests the Secretary-General, as the police contingent is being
deployed, to begin immediately preparing specific proposals for the drawdown of
an appropriate number of military personnel with the objective of ensuring there
is no increase in the cost of ONUMOZ without prejudice to the effective
discharge of its mandate;

4. Further requests the Secretary-—General to prepare a timetable for
(a) the completion of ONUMOZ's mandate, withdrawal of its personnel, and

the target date of the end of November 1994, by which time the elected
government is expected to have assumed office, and in this context, for (b) the
phased drawdown of military forces in the transportation corridors which should
begin as soon as feasible and be completed when the new national defence force
is operational, and (c) the withdrawal of military observers after
demobilization is completed;

General Peace Agreement including the commencement of the assembly of troops and

implementation of some major aspects of the General Peace Agreement, including
the commencement of demobilization and the formation of a national defence force
and calls upon the parties to work towards the elimination of further delays;

7. Calls upon the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO to comply with all
the provisions of the General Peace Agreement, in particular those concerning
the cease-fire and the cantonment and demobilization of troops, and commends in

implement the General Peace Agreement;

8. Further calls upon the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO to comply
fully and promptly with the decisions of the Monitoring and Supervision

expeditious and timely conclusion of this process as called for in the revised
timetable;

11. Underlines the need for the troops of the Government of Mozambique and
RENAMO to hand over all weapons to the United Nations at the assembly areas and
for the parties to come to an immediate agreement on the transfer of all weapons
to regional depots so as to ensure security in the assembly areas;

12. Reiterates the vital importance it attaches to the holding of general
elections no later than October 1994 and to the early commencement of electoral
registration and other electoral preparations, and urges the parties to agree
promptly on a specific election date;

13. Appeals to the international community to provide the necessary
financial assistance to facilitate the implementation of the General Peace
Agreement and also to make voluntary financial contributions to the Trust Fund
to be set up to support electoral activities of the political parties;
