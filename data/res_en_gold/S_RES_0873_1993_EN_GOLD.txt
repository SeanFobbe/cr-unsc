The Security Council,

Recalling its resolutions 841 1993 of 16 June 1993, 861 (1993) of
27 August 1993, 862 (1993) of 31 August 1993 and 867 (1993) of 23
September 1993,

Deeply disturbed by the continued obstruction of the arrival of the
United Nations Mission in Haiti, dispatched pursuant to resolution 867
(1993), and the failure of the armed forces of Haiti to carry out their
responsibilities to allow the Mission to begin its work,

Having received the report of the Secretary-General of 13 October 1993 26 informing the Council that the military authorities of Haiti,
including the police, have not complied in good faith with the Governors Island Agreement,

Determining that their failure to fulfil obligations under the Agreement constitutes a threat to peace and security in the region,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Decides, in accordance with paragraph 2 of resolution 861 (1993),
to terminate the suspension of the measures set out in paragraphs 5 to
9 of resolution 841 (1993) as of 2359 hours eastern standard time on
18 October 1993, unless the Secretary-General, having regard for the
views of the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States,
reports to the Council that the parties to the Governors Island Agreement and any other authorities in Haiti are implementing in full the
agreement to reinstate the legitimate Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and have established the necessary measures to
enable the United Nations Mission in Haiti to carry out its mandate,

2. Decides also that funds that are required to be frozen pursuant to
paragraph 8 of resolution 841 (1993) may be released at the request of
President Aristide or Prime Minister Malval of Haiti,

3. Decides further that the Committee of the Security Council
established pursuant to paragraph 10 of resolution 841 (1993) shall
have the authority, in addition to that set forth in the aforementioned
paragraph, to grant exceptions to the prohibitions (other than those
referred to in paragraph 2 above) referred to in paragraph 1 above on
a case-by-case basis under the no-objection procedure in response to
requests by President Aristide or Prime Minister Malval,

4. Confirms its readiness to consider urgently the imposition of
additional measures if the Secretary-General informs the Security
Council that the parties to the Governors Island Agreement or any other
authorities in Haiti continue to impede the activities of the Mission or
interfere with the freedom of movement and communication of the
Mission and its members as well as the other rights necessary for the
performance of its mandate, or have not complied in full with relevant
Council resolutions and the provisions of the Agreement,

5. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.

Adopted unanimously at the 3291st meeting.
