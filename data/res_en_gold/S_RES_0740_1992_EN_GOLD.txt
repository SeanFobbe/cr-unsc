Resolution 740 (1992)
of 7 February 1992

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolutions 713 (1991) of 25 September
1991, 721 (1991) of 27 November 1991, 724 (1991) of 15
December 1991 and 727 (1992) of 8 January 1992,

Taking note of the further report of the Secretary-General
of 4 February 1992 32 submitted pursuant to Security Council
resolution 721 (1991) and welcoming his report that the cease-fire has been generally observed thus removing one of the
obstacles to the deployment of a peace-keeping operation,

Noting that the letter from President Franjo Tudjman of 6
February 1992, 33 in which he accepts fully and unconditionally
the Secretary-Generalâ€™s concept and plan, which defines the
conditions and areas where the United Nations forces would be
deployed, removes a further obstacle in that respect,
Also noting that the implementation of the United Nations
peace-keeping plan contained in the report of the Secretary-General of 11 December 1991 34 will facilitate the task of the
Conference on Yugoslavia in reaching a political settlement,

Recalling its primary responsibility under the Charter of the
United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and
security,

Recalling also the provisions of Chapter VIII of the
Charter,

Expressing concern at the indications that the arms embargo
established by the Council in resolution 713 (1991) is not being
fully observed, as noted in paragraph 21 of the report of the
Secretary-General, 32
