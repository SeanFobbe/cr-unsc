on 10 November 1992

 

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 781 (1992) of 9 October 1992,

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General of 5 November 1992
(S/24767 and Add.1) and his subsequent letter of 6 November 1992 (S/24783)
submitted pursuant to resolution 781 (1992),

Considering that the establishment of a ban on military flights in the
airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina constitutes an essential element for the
safety of the delivery of humanitarian assistance and a decisive step for the
cessation of hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Taking into account the need for a speedy deployment of monitors on the
ground for observation and verification purposes,

Gravely concerned at the indication in the Secretary-Generalâ€™s letter of
6 November 1992 of possible violations of its resolution 781 (1992) and of the
impossibility of corroborating the information on such violations by technical
means presently available to the United Nations Protection Force,

Determined to ensure the safety of humanitarian flights to Bosnia and
Herzegovina,

1. Welcomes the current advance deployment of military observers of the
United Nations Protection Force and the European Community Monitoring Mission
at airfields in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro);

2. Reaffirms its ban on military flights in the airspace of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, which applies to all flights, whether of fixed-wing or
rotary-wing aircraft, subject to the exceptions contained in paragraph 1 of
its resolution 781 (1992), and reiterates that all parties and others
concerned must comply with this ban;

3. Endorses the general concept of operations described in the
Secretary-General's report and calls on all parties and others concerned,
including all Governments operating aircraft in the area, to cooperate fully
with the United Nations Protection Force in its implementation;

4. Calls upon all parties and others concerned henceforth to direct all
requests for authorizations of flights pursuant to paragraph 3 of its
resolution 781 (1992) to the United Nations Protection Force, with special
provisions being made for flights of the United Nations Protection Force, and
all other flights in support of United Nations operations, including
humanitarian assistance;

5. Approves the recommendation in paragraph 10 of the
Secretary-General's report that the strength of the United Nations Protection
Force be increased, as proposed in paragraph 5 of the report, in order to
permit it to implement the concept of operations;

6. Reiterates its determination to consider urgently, in the case of
violations when further reported to it in accordance with its resolution
781 (1992), the further measures necessary to enforce the ban on military
flights in the airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina;

7. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
