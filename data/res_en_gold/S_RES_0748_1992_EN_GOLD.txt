Resolution 748 (1992)
of 31 March 1992

The Security Council,
Reaffirming its resolution 731 (1992) of 21 January 1992,

Noting the reports of the Segretary-General of 11 February 168 and 3 March 1992 169 submitted pursuant to paragraph 4 of
Security Council resolution 731 (1992),

Deeply concerned that the Libyan Government has still not
provided a full and effective response to the requests in its
resolution 731 (1992),

Convinced that the suppression of acts of international
terrorism, including those in which States are directly or
indirectly involved, is essential for the maintenance of international peace and security,

Recalling that, in the statement issued on 31 January 1992
on the occasion of the meeting of the Security Council at the
level of heads of State and Government, 170 the members of the
Council expressed their deep concern over acts of international
terrorism, and emphasized the need for the international
community to deal effectively with all such acts,

Reaffirming that, in accordance with the principle in Article
2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations, every
State has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating,
assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another State or
acquiescing in organized activities within its territory directed
towards the commission of such acts, when such acts involve a
threat or use of force,

Determining, in this context, that the failure by the Libyan
Government to demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of terrorism and in particular its continued failure to
respond fully and effectively to the requests in resolution 731
(1992) constitute a threat to international peace and security,

Determined to eliminate international terrorism,

Charter, to consult the Security Council where they find
themselves confronted with special economic problems arising
from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures,
