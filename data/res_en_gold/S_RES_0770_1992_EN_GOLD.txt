Underlining once again the imperative need for an urgent negotiated

to enable that country to live in peace and security within its borders,

Reaffirming the need to respect the Sovereignty, territorial integrity
and political independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Recognizing that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina constitutes a
threat to international peace and security and that the provision of
humanitarian assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina is an important element in
the Council's effort to restore international peace and security in the area,

Commending the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for its
continuing action in support of the relief operation in Sarajevo and other
parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Deeply disturbed by the situation that now prevails in Sarajevo, which
has severely complicated UNPROFOR's efforts to fulfil its mandate to ensure
the security and functioning of Sarajevo airport and the delivery of
humanitarian assistance in Sarajevo and other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina
pursuant to resolutions 743 (1992), 749 (1992), 761 (1992) and 764 (1992) and
the reports of the Secretary-General cited therein,

Dismayed by the continuation of conditions that impede the delivery of
humanitarian supplies to destinations within Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
consequent suffering of the people of that country,

Deeply concerned by reports of abuses against civilians imprisoned in
camps, prisons and detention centres,

Determined to establish as soon as possible the necessary conditions for
the delivery of humanitarian assistance wherever needed in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, in conformity with resolution 764 (1992),

needed in other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina;

3. Demands that unimpeded and continuous access to all camps, prisons
and detention centres be granted immediately to the International Committee of
the Red Cross and other relevant humanitarian organizations and that all
detainees therein receive humane treatment, including adequate food, shelter
and medical care;

4. Calls upon States to report to the Secretary-General on measures
they are taking in coordination with the United Nations to carry out this
resolution, and invites the Secretary-General to keep under continuous review
any further measures that may be necessary to ensure unimpeded delivery of
humanitarian supplies;

5. Requests all States to provide appropriate support for the actions
undertaken in pursuance of this resolution;

6. Demands that all parties and others concerned take the necessary
measures to ensure the safety of United Nations and other personnel engaged in
