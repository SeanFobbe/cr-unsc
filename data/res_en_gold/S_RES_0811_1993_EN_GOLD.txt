Resolution 811 (1993)
of 12 March 1993

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolutions 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991, 747 (1992)
of 24 March 1992, 785 (1992) of 30 October 1992, 793 (1992) of 30
November 1992 and 804 (1993) of 29 January 1993,

Gravely disturbed by the recent outbreak of heavy fighting in many
parts of Angola, the large number of casualties and massive loss of
human life which have ensued and the further deterioration of the
already dangerous political and military situation, bringing the country
to the verge of the resumption of civil war,

Gravely concerned at the persistent violations by the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola of the major provisions of the
Peace Accords for Angola,

Also concerned at reports that military support and equipment
continue to flow in contravention of the Peace Accords,

Noting with particular concern that a humanitarian tragedy of grave
proportions is developing in Angola and the need, therefore, for
increased international humanitarian assistance,

Deeply regretting that the second meeting between the delegations
of the Government of Angola and the National Union, which had been
scheduled to be held on 26 February 1993 at Addis Ababa under the
auspices of the United Nations, did not take place because of the failure
by the National Union to fulfil its commitment to send a delegationa,

Noting with satisfaction the readiness displayed by the Government
of Angola to participate in the Addis Ababa meeting,

Reaffirming its commitment to preserve the unity and territorial
integrity of Angola,

Welcoming and supporting the efforts of the Secretary-General and
his Special Representative aimed at resolving the present crisis through
negotiations,

1. Strongly condemns the persistent violations by the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola of the major provisions of the
Peace Accords for Angola, in particular the continued rejection by the
National Union of the results of the elections held on 29 and 30
September 1992, which the Special Representative of the Secretary-General determined to be generally free and fair, its failure to take part
in the political institutions established on the basis of those elections, its
failure to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Government of
Angola, its withdrawal from the new Angolan armed forces and its
seizure by force of provincial capitals and municipalities and the
resumption of hostilities;

2. Demands that the National Union accept unreservedly the results
of the democratic elections of 1992 and abide fully by the Peace
Accords, and also demands that the two parties, particularly the
National Union, produce early evidence, not later than 30 March 1993,
that real progress has been made towards the implementation of the
Accords,

3. Strongly demands an immediate cease-fire throughout the
country, and also demands the resumption without delay and without
preconditions of a continued and meaningful dialogue under United
Nations auspices so that a clear timetable for the completion of the
implementation of the Peace Accords may be established;

4. Reaffirms that it will hold responsible any party which refuses to
take part in such a dialogue, thereby jeopardizing the entire process, and
will consider all appropriate measures under the Charter of the United
Nations to advance the implementation of the Peace Accords,

5. Strongly condemns verbal and physical attacks against the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General and personnel in Angola of the
United Nations Angola Verification Mission II, and demands that these
attacks cease forthwith and that the Government of Angola and the
National Union take all necessary measures to ensure their safety and
security;

6. Condemns the kidnapping of a Mission military observer in
Cabinda on 23 February 1993 and demands that he be released
unharmed and unconditionally and without further delay,

7. Fully supports the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in their continuing efforts to restore the peace process and to carry
out the mandate of the Mission under extremely difficult conditions,

8. Invites the Secretary-General to seek to organize a meeting
between the Government of Angola and the National Union at the
highest possible level with a view to securing the full implementation
of the Peace Accords, which meeting is to take place in good time
before 30 April 1993, and to consider also the future role of the United
Nations in Angola, and encourages the parties to respond positively,

9. Requests the Secretary-General, pending the submission of the
report referred to in paragraph 16 of resolution 804 (1993), to present
as soon as possible a progress report on the efforts for the resumption
of the talks between the two parties in Angola at all appropriate levels,

10. Calls on all Member States, United Nations agencies and
non-governmental organizations to accord or increase humanitarian
relief assistance to Angola, and encourages the Special Representative
of the Secretary-General, with the resources at her disposal, to
coordinate the provision of humanitarian assistance to the civilian
population in need;

11. Strongly appeals to both parties strictly to abide by applicable
tules of international humanitarian law, including unimpeded access for
humanitarian assistance to the civilian population in need,

12. Appeals once again to all Member States to render economic, material and technical assistance to the Government of Angola
for the reconstruction and development of the country,

13. Looks forward to the report of the Secretary-General referred
to in paragraph 16 of resolution 804 (1993) on the situation in Angola,
together with his recommendations for the further role of the United
Nations in the peace process;

14. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
