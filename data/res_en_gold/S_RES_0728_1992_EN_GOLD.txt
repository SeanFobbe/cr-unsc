Resolution 728 (1992)
of 8 January 1992

The Security Council,

Recalling its resolutions 668 (1990) of 20 September 1990,
717 (1991) of 16 October 1991 and 718 (1991) of 31 October
1991,

Welcoming the fact that the United Nations Advance
Mission in Cambodia has become operational as reported by
the Secretary-General in his report of 14 November 1991, 109

Welcoming also the progress that has been made in
implementing the provisions of the agreements on a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodia conflict signed in
Paris on 23 October 1991 110 relating to the functioning of the
Supreme National Council of Cambodia under the chairmanship of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the
maintenance of the cease-fire,

Concerned that the existence of mines and minefields in
Cambodia poses a serious hazard to the safety of people in
Cambodia, as well as an obstacle to the smooth and timely
implementation of the agreements, including the early return of
Cambodian refugees and displaced persons,

Noting that the Missionâ€™s mandate as approved by the
Security Council in its resolution 717 (1991) provides, inter alia,
for the establishment of a mine-awareness programme, and that
the agreements provide for the United Nations Transitional
Authority in Cambodia to undertake, inter alia, a programme
of assisting with clearing mines and undertaking training
programmes in mine clearance and a mine-awareness programme among the Cambodian people,

Considering that the establishment of training programmes
in mine clearance, in addition to the existing mine-awareness
programme undertaken by the Mission, and the early initiation
of mine clearance are required for the effective implementation
of the agreements,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on
Cambodia of 30 December 1991 and 6 January 1992 111 proposing that the mandate of the Mission be expanded to include
training in mine clearance and the initiation of a mine-clearance programme,

1. Approves the report of the Secretary-General on
Cambodia of 30 December 1991 and 6 January 1992, 111 especially the provision of assistance in mine clearing by
Cambodians;

2. Calls upon the Supreme National Council of Cambodia, and all the Cambodian parties, to continue to cooperate
fully with the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia,
including in the discharge of its expanded mandate;

3. Reiterates its call to all the Cambodian parties to
comply scrupulously with the cease-fire and to lend all necessary assistance to the Mission;

4. Requests the Secretary-General to keep the Security
Council informed of further developments.

Adopted unanimously at the 3029th
meeting.
