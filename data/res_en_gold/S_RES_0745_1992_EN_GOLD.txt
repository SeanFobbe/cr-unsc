for the deployment of a United Nations Transitional Authority
in Cambodia,

Noting with appreciation the efforts of His Royal Highness
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Supreme National Council
of Cambodia under his chairmanship in regard to the implementation of the provisions of the agreements,

Welcoming the appointment by the Secretary-General of a
Special Representative for Cambodia to act on his behalf,

1. Approves the report of the Secretary-General on
Cambodia of 19 and 26 February 1992 118 containing his plan,

objectives of the agreements;

Cambodia and all Cambodians on behalf of the host country to
provide all necessary assistance and facilities to the Authority;

complete demobilization of their military forces prior to the
end of the process of registration for the elections as well as to
the destruction of the weapons and ammunition deposited into
the Authority’s custody in excess of those, if any, which may be
deemed necessary by the Authority for the maintenance of civil
order and national defence, or which may be required by the
new Cambodian Government;

9. Appeals to all States to provide all voluntary assistance
and support necessary to the United Nations and its programmes and specialized agencies for the preparations and
