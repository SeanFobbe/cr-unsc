The Security Council,

Having heard the statements of the Minister for
External Relations of the Republic of Nicaragua, 37

Having also heard the statements of the representatives of various States Members of the United
Nations in the course of the debate,

Deeply concerned, on the one hand, at the situation prevailing on and inside the northern border of
Nicaragua and, on the other hand, at the consequent
danger of a military confrontation between Honduras
and Nicaragua, which could further aggravate the
existing critical situation in Central America,

Recalling all the relevant principles of the Charter
of the United Nations, particularly the obligation of
States to settle their disputes exclusively by peaceful
means, not to resort to the threat or use of force and
to respect the self-determination of peoples and the
sovereign independence of all States,

Noting the widespread desire expressed by the
States concerned to achieve solutions to the differences
between them,

Commending the appeal of the Contadora Group
of countries, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela, in its 12 May 1983 communiqu√©, 38 that the
deliberations of the Council should strengthen the
principles of self-determination and non-interference
in the affairs of other States, the obligation not to allow
the territory of a State to be used for committing acts
of aggression against other States, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the prohibition of the threat or
use of force to resolve conflict,

Considering the broad support expressed for the
efforts of the Contadora Group to achieve solutions
to the problems that affect Central American countries
and to secure a stable and lasting peace in the region,

1. Reaffirms the right of Nicaragua and of all the
other countries of the area to live in peace and security, free from outside interference;

2. Commends the efforts of the Contadora Group
and urges the pursuit of those efforts;

3. Appeals urgently to the interested States to
co-operate fully with the Contadora Group, through a

differences;

to find solutions to the problems of the region and to
keep the Security Council informed of the results of
these efforts;

5. Requests the Secretary-General to keep the
Council informed of the development of the situation
and of the implementation of the present resolution.
