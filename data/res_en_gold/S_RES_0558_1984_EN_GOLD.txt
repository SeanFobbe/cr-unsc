Resolution 558 (1984)
of 13 December 1984

The Security Council,

Recalling its resolution 418 (1977), in which it
decided upon a mandatory arms embargo against South
Africa,

Recalling its resolution 421 (1977), by which it
entrusted a Committee consisting of all its members
with the task of, among other things, studying ways
and means by which the mandatory arms embargo
could be made more effective against South Africa
and to make recommendations to the Council,

Taking note of the Committee’s report to the Security Council contained in document S/14179 of 19 September 1980,

Recognizing that South Africa’s intensified efforts
to build up its capacity to manufacture armaments
undermines the effectiveness of the mandatory arms
embargo against South Africa,

Considering that no State should contribute to
South Africa’s arms-production capability by purchasing arms manufactured in South Africa,

1. Reaffirms its resolution 418 (1977) and stresses
the continuing need for the strict application of all its
provisions;

2. Requests all States to refrain from importing
arms, ammunition of all types and military vehicles
produced in South Africa;

3. Requests all States, including States not Members of the United Nations, to act strictly in accordance
with the provisions of the present resolution;

4. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the
Security Council Committee established by resolution
421 (1977) concerning the question of South Africa
on the progress of the implementation of the present
resolution before 31 December 1985.

Adopted unanimously at the
2564th meeting.
