Recalling the Secretary-Generalâ€™s view that the situation in the Middle East as a whole continues to be
unstable and potentially dangerous and is likely to
remain so unless and until a comprehensive settlement
covering all aspects of the Middle East problem can
be reached, and his hope that urgent efforts will be
pursued by all concerned to tackle the problem in all
its aspects, with a view both to maintaining quiet in
the region and to arriving at a just and durable peace
settlement, as called for by the Security Council in its
resolution 338 (1973),

1. Decides to renew the mandate of the United
Nations Emergency Force for a period of nine months,
that is, until 24 July 1979;

2. Requests the Secretary-General to submit at the
end of this period a report on the developments in the
situation and on the steps taken to implement Security
Council resolution 338 (1973);

3. Expresses its confidence that the Force will be
maintained with maximum efficiency and economy.
