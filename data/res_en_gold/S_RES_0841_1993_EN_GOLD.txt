Adopted by the Security Council at its 3238th meeting,
on 16 June 1993

 

The Security Council,

Having received a letter from the Permanent Representative of Haiti to the
President of the Council dated 7 June 1993 (S/25958) requesting that the Council
make universal and mandatory the trade embargo on Haiti recommended by the
Organization of American States,

Having also heard a report of the Secretary-General on 10 June 1993
regarding the crisis in Haiti,

Noting resolutions MRE/RES.1/91, MRE/RES.2/91, MRE/RES.3/92 and
MRE/RES.4/92 adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American
States, and resolution CP/RES.594 (923/92) and declarations CP/Dec.8 (927/93),
CP/Dec.9 (931/93) and CP/Dec.10 (934/93) adopted by the Permanent Council of the
Organization of American States,

Noting in particular resolution MRE/RES.5/93 adopted by the Foreign
Ministers of the Organization of American States in Managua, Nicaragua, on
6 June 1993,

Recalling General Assembly resolutions 46/7 of 11 October 1991, 46/138
of 17 December 1991, 47/20 A of 24 November 1992, 47/143 of 18 December 1992 and
47/20 B of 23 April 1993,

Strongly supportive of the continuing leadership by the Secretary-General
of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American
States and of the efforts of the international community to reach a political
solution to the crisis in Haiti,

Commending the efforts undertaken by the Special Envoy for Haiti of the
United Nations and Organization of American States Secretaries-General,
Mr. Dante Caputo, to establish a political dialogue with the Haitian parties
with a view to resolving the crisis in Haiti,

Recognizing the urgent need for an early, comprehensive and peaceful
settlement of the crisis in Haiti in accordance with the provisions of the
Charter of the United Nations and international law,

Also recalling the statement of 26 February 1993 (S/25344), in which the
Council noted with concern the incidence of humanitarian crises, including mass
displacements of population, becoming or aggravating threats to international
peace and security,

Deploring the fact that, despite the efforts of the international
community, the legitimate Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has not
been reinstated,

Concerned that the persistence of this situation contributes to a climate
of fear of persecution and economic dislocation which could increase the number
of Haitians seeking refuge in neighbouring Member States and convinced that a
reversal of this situation is needed to prevent its negative repercussions on
the region,

Recalling, in this respect, the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter
of the United Nations, and stressing the need for effective cooperation between
regional organizations and the United Nations,

Considering that the above-mentioned request of the Permanent
Representative of Haiti, made within the context of the related actions
previously taken by the Organization of American States and by the General
Assembly of the United Nations, defines a unique and exceptional situation
warranting extraordinary measures by the Security Council in support of the
efforts undertaken within the framework of the Organization of American States,
and,

Determining that, in these unique and exceptional circumstances, the
continuation of this situation threatens international peace and security in the
region,

Acting, therefore, under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Affirms that the solution of the crisis in Haiti should take into
account the above-mentioned resolutions of the Organization of American States
and of the General Assembly of the United Nations;

Organization of American States, has reported to the Council that, in light of
the results of the negotiations conducted by the Special Envoy for Haiti of the
United Nations and Organization of American States Secretaries-General, the
imposition of such measures is not warranted at that time;

4. Decides that if at any time after the submission of the

or controlled by such Government or authorities, shall require all persons and
entities within their own territories holding such funds to freeze them to
ensure that they are not made available directly or indirectly to or for the
benefit of the de facto authorities in Haiti;
