The Security Council,

Recalling the Iraqi invasion and purported annexation
of Kuwait, and its resolutions 660 (1990) of 2 August 1990,
661 (1990) of 6 August 1990 and 662 (1990) of 9 August
1990,

Deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of
third-State nationals in Iraq and Kuwait,

Recalling the obligations of Iraq in this regard under
international law,

Welcoming the efforts of the Secretary-General to pursue
urgent consultations with the Government of Iraq following the concern and anxiety expressed by the members of
the Council on 17 August 1990,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United
Nations,

1. Demands that Iraq permit and facilitate the immediate departure from Kuwait and Iraq of third-State nationals
and grant immediate and continuing access of consular
officials to such nationals;

2. Also demands that Iraq take no action to jeopardize
the safety, security or health of such nationals;

3. Reaffirms its decision in resolution 662 (1990) that
annexation of Kuwait by Iraq is null and void, and therefore demands that the Government of Iraq rescind its
orders for the closure of diplomatic and consular missions
in Kuwait and the withdrawal of the immunity of their
personnel, and refrain from any such actions in the future;

4. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on compliance with the present resolution
at the earliest possible time.
