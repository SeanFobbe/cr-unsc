General to accelerate contingency planning for a possible United Nations role in
the election process, including coordination with the observer missions of the
Organization of African Unity, the Commonwealth and the European Union, to
enable expeditious consideration of a request to the United Nations for such
assistance,

Noting General Assembly resolutions 48/159 A of 20 December 1993 and 48/230

Commonwealth and the European Union,

Having considered the request of the Transitional Executive Council that
the United Nations provide a sufficient number of international observers to
monitor the electoral process and to coordinate the activities of the

participate fully in the multi-party talks, to respect agreements reached during
the negotiations, to adhere to democratic principles, and to take part in the
elections;

held accountable for such actions;

security of the international observers and to facilitate the carrying out of
