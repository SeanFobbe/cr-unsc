Resolution 694 (1991)
of 24 May 1991

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 681 (1990) of 20 December 1990,

Having learned with deep concern and consternation that
Israel has, in violation of its obligations under the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in
Time of War, of 12 August 1949,4 and acting in opposition to
relevant Security Council resolutions, and to the detriment of
efforts to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East, deported four Palestinian civilians on 18 May
1991,

1. Declares that the action of the Israeli authorities of
deporting four Palestinians on 18 May 1991 is in violation of
the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian
Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, 4 which is applicable to all the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since
1967, including Jerusalem;

2. Deplores this action and reiterates that Israel, the
occupying Power, must refrain from deporting any Palestinian
civilian from the occupied territories and ensure the safe and
immediate return of all those deported;

3. Decides to keep the situation under review.
Adopted unanimously at the 2989th
meeting
