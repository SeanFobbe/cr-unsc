Resolution 883 (1993)
11 November 1993

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolutions 731 (1992) of 21 January 1992 and 748
(1992) of 31 March 1992,

Deeply concerned that after more than twenty months the Libyan
Government has not fully complied with these resolutions,

Determined to eliminate international terrorism,

Convinced that those responsible for acts of international terrorism
must be brought to justice,

Convinced also that the suppression of acts of international
terrorism, including those in which States are directly or indirectly
involved, is essential for the maintenance of international peace and
security,

Determining, in this context, that the continued failure by the Libyan
Government to demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of
terrorism, and in particular its continued failure to respond fully and
effectively to the requests and decisions in resolutions 731 (1992) and
748 (1992), constitute a threat to international peace and security,

Taking note of the letters to the Secretary-General dated 29 September and 1 October 1993 from the Secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation of Libya 7 and his speech in the general debate at the forty-eighth session of the.
General Assembly 8 in which Libya stated its intention to encourage
those charged with the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 to appear for trial
in Scotland and its willingness to cooperate with the competent French
authorities in the case of the bombing of Union de Transports Aériens
flight 772,

Expressing its gratitude to the Secretary-General for the efforts he
has made pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 731 (1992),
