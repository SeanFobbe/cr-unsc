Resolution 649 (1990)
of 12 March 1990

The Security Council,

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General
of 8 March 1990°? on the recent meeting between the
leaders of the two communities in Cyprus and on his
assessment of the current situation,

Recalling its relevant resolutions on Cyprus,

Recalling also the statement made by the President of
the Security Council on 22 February 1990 49 calling upon
the leaders of the two communities to demonstrate the
necessary goodwill and flexibility and to cooperate with
the Secretary-General so that the talks will result in a major
step forward toward the resolution of the Cyprus problem,

Expressing its regret that, in the more than twenty-five
years since the establishment of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, it has not been possible to
achieve a negotiated settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus
problem,

Concerned that, at the recent meeting in New York, it
was not possible to achieve results in arriving at an agreed
outline of an overall agreement,

1. Reaffirms in particular its resolution 367 (1975) of
12 March 1975 as well as its support for the 1977 53 and
1979°4 high-level agreements between the leaders of the
two communities in which they pledged to establish a
bi-communal Federal Republic of Cyprus that will safeguard its independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity
and non-alignment, and exclude union in whole or in part
with any other country and any form of partition or secession;

2. Expresses its full support for the current effort of the
Secretary-General in carrying out his mission of good
offices concerning Cyprus;

3. Calls upon the leaders of the two communities to
pursue their efforts to reach freely a mutually acceptable
solution providing for the establishment of a federation
that will be bi-communal as regards the constitutional
aspects and bi-zonal as regards the territorial aspects, in
line with the present resolution and their 1977 and 1979
high-level agreements, and to co-operate, on an equal
footing, with the Secretary-General in completing, in the
first instance and on an urgent basis, an outline of an
overall agreement, as agreed in June 1989;

4. Requests the Secretary-General to pursue his mission of good offices in order to achieve the earliest possible
progress and, toward this end, to assist the two communities by making suggestions to facilitate the discussions;

5. Calls upon the parties concerned to refrain from any
action that could aggravate the situation;

6. Decides to remain actively seized of the situation
and the current effort;

7. Requests the Secretary-General to inform the Security Council, in his report due by 31 May 1990, of the
progress made in resuming the intensive talks and in developing an agreed outline of an overall agreement in line
with the present resolution.

Adopted unanimously at the
2909th meeting.
