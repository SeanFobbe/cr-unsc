Resolution 667 (1990)
of 16 September 1990

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolutions 660 (1990) of 2 August 1990,
661 (1990) of 6 August 1990, 662 (1990) of 9 August 1990,
664 (1990) of 18 August 1990, 665 (1990) of 25 August
1990 and 666 (1990) of 13 September 1990,

Recalling the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961 106 and the Vienna Convention on
Consular Relations of 24 April 1963, 107 to both of which
Iraq is a party,

Considering that the decision of Iraq to order the closure
of diplomatic and consular missions in Kuwait and to
withdraw the privileges and immunities of these missions
and their personnel is contrary to the decisions of the
Security Council, the international conventions mentioned
above and international law,

Deeply concerned that Iraq, notwithstanding the decisions of the Council and the provisions of the conventions
mentioned above, has committed acts of violence against
diplomatic missions and their personnel in Kuwait,

Outraged at recent violations by Iraq of diplomatic
premises in Kuwait and at the abduction of personnel
enjoying diplomatic immunity and foreign nationals who
were present in these premises,

Considering also that these actions by Iraq constitute
aggressive acts and a flagrant violation of its international
obligations which strike at the root of the conduct of
international relations in accordance with the Charter of
the United Nations,

Recalling that Iraq is fully responsible for any use of
violence against foreign nationals or against any diplomatic or consular mission in Kuwait or its personnel,

Determined to ensure respect for its decisions and for
Article 25 of the Charter,

Considering further that the grave nature of Iraq’s actions, which constitute a new escalation of its violations of
international law, obliges the Council not only to express
its immediate reaction but also to consult urgently in order
to take further concrete measures to ensure Iraq’s compliance with the Council’s resolutions,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter,
1. Strongly condemns aggressive acts perpetrated by
Iraq against diplomatic premises and personnel in Kuwait,
including the abduction of foreign nationals who were
present in those premises;

2. Demands the immediate release of those foreign
nationals as well as all nationals mentioned in resolution
664 (1990);

3. Also demands that Iraq immediately and fully comply with its international obligations under resolutions 660
(1990), 662 (1990) and 664 (1990), the Vienna Convention
on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961, 106 the Vienna
Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963 107 and
international law;

4. Further demands that Iraq immediately protect the
safety and well-being of diplomatic and consular personnel
and premises in Kuwait and in Iraq and take no action to
hinder the diplomatic and consular missions in the performance of their functions, including access to their nationals and the protection of their person and interests;

5. Reminds all States that they are obliged to observe
strictly resolutions 661 (1990), 662 (1990), 664 (1990),
665 (1990) and 666 (1990);

6. Decides to consult urgently to take further concrete
measures as soon as possible, under Chapter VII of the
Charter, in response to Iraq’s continued violation of the
Charter of the United Nations, of resolutions of the Security Council and of international law.

Adopted unanimously at the
2940th meeting.
