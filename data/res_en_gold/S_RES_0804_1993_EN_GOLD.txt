RESOLUTION 804 (1993)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3168th meeting,
on 29 January 1993

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolutions 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991, 747 (1992) of
24 March 1992, 785 (1992) of 30 October 1992 and 793 (1992) of
30 November 1992,

Having considered the further report of the Secretary-General dated
21 January 1993 (S/25140 and Add.1),

Having considered also the request submitted to the Secretary-General by
the Government of Angola in its letter dated 21 January 1993 (S/25155),

Gravely disturbed by the recent outbreak of heavy fighting in many parts
of Angola and the further deterioration of the already dangerous political and
military situation in that country,

Gravely concerned at the continuing non-implementation of the major
provisions of the "Acordos de Paz para Angola",

Concerned at the recent absence of dialogue between the Government of
Angola and UNITA, and welcoming the meeting between them under United Nations
auspices in Addis Ababa to discuss the cease-fire and political matters,

Also concerned at the outrageous harassment and physical abuse to which
UNAVEM II personnel have been subjected, and the looting and destruction of
United Nations property, as described in the above-mentioned report of the
Secretary-General,

Further concerned at reports of foreign support for and involvement in
military actions in Angola,

Regretting that the deteriorating situation has made it increasingly
difficult for UNAVEM II to carry out its mandate,

Recalling that democratic elections were held on 29 and
30 September 1992, which the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
certified as being generally free and fair, and that steps have been taken to
set up a Government of National Unity which would reflect the results of the
legislative elections, and deeply regretting the failure of UNITA to take part
in the political institutions thus established,

Reaffirming its commitment to preserve the unity and territorial
integrity of Angola,

Recognizing that the Angolans themselves bear ultimate responsibility for
the restoration of peace and national reconciliation of their country,

Reiterating its support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his
Special Representative aimed at resolving the present crisis and resuming the
political process, in particular through the completion of the electoral
process,

1. Notes with appreciation the above-mentioned report of the
Secretary-General;

2. Strongly condemns the persistent violations of the main provisions

seizure by force of provincial capitals and municipalities and the resumption
of hostilities;

3. Demands that the two parties cease fire immediately, restore at
their meeting in Addis Ababa continued and meaningful dialogue, and agree on a
clear timetable for the full implementation of the “Acordos de Paz", in
particular with regard to confinement of their troops and collection of their
weapons, demobilization and formation of the unified national armed forces,
effective restoration of the Government administration throughout the country,
the completion of the electoral process and the free circulation of people and
goods;

4. Supports fully the Secretary-General and his Special Representative
in their continuing efforts to restore the peace process and to carry out the

immediately and effectively any direct or indirect military or paramilitary
interference from their territories and to respect scrupulously the provisions
of the "Acordos de Paz" concerning the cessation of supply of lethal material
to any Angolan party;

10. Strongly condemns violations of international humanitarian law, in
particular the attacks against the civilian population, including the
extensive killings carried out by armed civilians, and calls upon both parties
to abide by their obligations thereunder and the appropriate provisions of the
“Acordos de Paz";

hostage;

paragraph 29 of the report of the Secretary-General;

15. Decides to extend the mandate of UNAVEM II for a period of three
months until 30 April 1993, with the proviso that, as a provisional measure
based on security considerations, the Secretary-General is authorized to
concentrate UNAVEM II deployment in Luanda, and at his discretion in other
provincial locations, with the levels of equipment and personnel he deems
appropriate to be retained in order to allow the subsequent expeditious
redeployment of UNAVEM II as soon as this becomes feasible, with a view to the
resumption of its functions in accordance with the “Acordos de Paz" and
previous resolutions on this matter;

16. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to it as soon as the
Situation warrants, and in any case before 30 April 1993, a report on the

the United Nations in the peace process, and in the meantime to keep the
Council regularly informed;

the period of the mandate authorized by this resolution, on the recommendation
of the Secretary-General, to expand substantially the United Nations presence
in Angola in the event of significant progress in the peace process;
