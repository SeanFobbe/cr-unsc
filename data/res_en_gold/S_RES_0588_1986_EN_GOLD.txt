Resolution 588 (1986)
of 8 October 1986

The Security Council,

Having considered the question entitled “The situation
between Iran and Iraq”,

Noting that the Council has been seized with this question for over six years and that decisions have been taken
thereon,

Deeply alarmed about the prolongation and intensification of the conflict resulting in heavy losses of human lives
and considerable material damage and endangering international peace and security,

Noting the obligation of Member States to refrain in
their international relations from the threat or use of force
against the territorial integrity or political independence
of any State, or from acting in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,

Recalling the provisions of the Charter of the United
Nations and in particular the obligation of all Member
States to settle their international disputes by peaceful
means in such a manner that international peace and
security and justice are not endangered,

Recalling further that, under the Charter, Member
States have conferred on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace
and security and to this end have agreed to accept the role
of the Security Council in the settlement of disputes,

Commending the efforts of the Secretary-General in the
search for a peaceful settlement of the conflict,

1. Calls upon the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq to
implement fully and without delay resolution 582 (1986)
adopted unanimously on 24 February 1986;

2. Requests the Secretary-General to intensify his efforts with the parties to give effect to the above-mentioned
resolution and to report to the Council no later than
30 November 1986,

3. Decides to meet again to consider the report of the
Secretary-General and the conditions for the establishment of a durable peace between the two countries in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the
principles of justice and international law.
