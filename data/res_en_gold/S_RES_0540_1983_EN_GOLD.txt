parties,

Recalling the report of the Secretary-General of
20 June 1983 28 on the mission appointed by him to
inspect civilian areas in Iran and Iraq which have been
subject to military attacks, and expressing its appreciation to the Secretary-General for presenting a
factual, balanced and objective account,

Also noting with appreciation and encouragement
the assistance and co-operation given to the Secretary-Generalâ€™s mission by the Governments of Iran and
Iraq,

countries, resulting in heavy losses of civilian lives
and extensive damage caused to cities, property and
economic infrastructures,

Affirming the desirability of an objective examination of the causes of the war,
1. Requests the Secretary-General to continue his
mediation efforts with the parties concerned, with a
view to achieving a comprehensive, just and honourable settlement acceptable to both sides;

Geneva Conventions of 1949 in all their aspects,
and calls for the immediate cessation of all military
operations against civilian targets, including city and
residential areas;

respect this right and also calls upon the belligerents

all ports with direct or indirect access to the sea, and
to respect the integrity of the other littoral States;

the parties concerning ways to sustain and verify the
cessation of hostilities, including the possible dispatch

to the Security Council on the results of these consultations;

action that may endanger peace and security as well
as marine life in the region of the Gulf;

6. Calls once more upon all other States to exercise
the utmost restraint and to refrain from any act which

the present resolution;

the parties regarding immediate and effective implementation of the present resolution.
