Member States cooperating with Kuwait under paragraph 2 of
resolution 678 (1990) to bring their military presence in Iraq to
an end as soon as possible consistent with paragraph 8 of
resolution 686 (1991),

Reaffirming the need to be assured of Iraq’s peaceful
intentions in the light of its unlawful invasion and occupation
of Kuwait,

Taking note of the letter dated 27 February 1991 from the
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq
addressed to the President of the Security Council 41 and of his
letters of the same date addressed to the President of the
Council and to the Secretary-General, and those letters dated
3 March 56 and 5 March 57 he addressed to them, pursuant to
resolution 686 (1991),

Noting that Iraq and Kuwait, as independent sovereign
States, signed at Baghdad on 4 October 1963 "Agreed Minutes
between the State of Kuwait and the Republic of Iraq regarding
the restoration of friendly relations, recognition and related
matters", 58 thereby formally recognizing the boundary between
Iraq and Kuwait and the allocation of islands, which Agreed
Minutes were registered with the United Nations in accordance
with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations and in
which Iraq recognized the independence and complete sovereignty of the State of Kuwait with its boundaries as specified in
the letter of the Prime Minister of Iraq dated 21 July 1932 and
as accepted by the ruler of Kuwait in his letter dated 10 August
1932,

Conscious of the need for demarcation of the said boundary,

Conscious also of the statements by Iraq threatening to use
weapons in violation of its obligations under the Protocol for
the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous
or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare,
signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925, 59 and of its prior use of
chemical weapons, and affirming that grave consequences would
follow any further use by Iraq of such weapons,

Recalling that Iraq has subscribed to the Final Declaration
adopted by all States participating in the Conference of States
Parties to the 1925 Geneva Protocol and Other Interested
States, held in Paris from 7 to 11 January 1989, 60 establishing

weapons,

Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their
Destruction, of 10 April 1972, 61

Noting the importance of Iraq ratifying the Convention,

Noting also the importance of all States adhering to the
Convention and encouraging its forthcoming review conference
to reinforce the authority, efficiency and universal scope of the
Convention,

Stressing the importance of an early conclusion by the
Conference on Disarmament of its work on a convention on the
universal prohibition of chemical weapons and of universal
adherence thereto,

Aware of the use by Iraq of ballistic missiles in unprovoked
attacks and therefore of the need to take specific measures in
regard to such missiles located in Iraq,

Concerned by the reports in the hands of Member States
that Iraq has attempted to acquire materials for a nuclear-weapons programme contrary to its obligations under the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1 July
1968,

Recalling the objective of the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East,

Conscious of the threat that all weapons of mass destruction pose to peace and security in the area and of the need to
work towards the establishment in the Middle East of a zone
free of such weapons,

Conscious also of the objective of achieving balanced and
comprehensive control of armaments in the region,

Conscious further of the importance of achieving the
objectives noted above using all available means, including a
dialogue among the States of the region,

Noting that resolution 686 (1991) marked the lifting of the
measures imposed by resolution 661 (1990) in so far as they
applied to Kuwait,

Noting also that despite the progress being made in
fulfilling the obligations of resolution 686 (1991), many Kuwaiti
and third-State nationals are still not accounted for and
property remains unreturned,

Recalling the International Convention against the Taking
of Hostages, 63 opened for signature in New York on 18
December 1979, which categorizes all acts of taking hostages as
manifestations of international terrorism,

Deploring threats made by Iraq during the recent conflict
to make use of terrorism against targets outside Iraq and the
taking of hostages by Iraq,

by the Secretary-General on 20 March 53 and 28 March 1991, 54
