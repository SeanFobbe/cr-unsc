RESOLUTION 773 (1992)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3108th meeting on 26 August 1992

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991, and in particular
paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 thereof, and its resolution 689 (1991) of 9 April 1991,

Recalling the report of the Secretary-General dated 2 May 1991 concerning
the establishment of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation
Commission (the Commission) and the subsequent exchange of letters of 6 and
13 May 1991 (S/22558, S/22592 and S/22593),

Having considered the Secretary-General's letter of 12 August 1992 to the
President of the Security Council transmitting the further report of the
Commission,

Recalling in this connection that through the demarcation process the
Commission is not reallocating territory between Kuwait and Iraq, but it is
simply carrying out the technical task necessary to demarcate for the first
time the precise coordinates of the boundary set out in the Agreed Minutes
between the State of Kuwait and the Republic of Iraq regarding the restoration
of Friendly Relations, Recognition and Related Matters signed by them on
4 October 1963, and that this task is being carried out in the special
circumstances following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and pursuant to resolution
687 (1991) and the Secretary-General's report for implementing paragraph 3 of
that resolution (S/22558),

1. Welcomes the Secretary-General's letter of 12 August to the
President of the Council and the further report of the Commission enclosed
therewith;

2. Expresses its appreciation to the Commission for its work on the
demarcation of the land boundary, and welcomes its demarcation decisions;

3. Welcomes also the decision of the Commission to consider the Eastern
section of the boundary, which includes the offshore boundary, at its next
session and urges the Commission to demarcate this part of the boundary as
soon as possible and thus complete its work;

4. Underlines its guarantee of the inviolability of the above-mentioned
international boundary and its decision to take as appropriate all necessary
measures to that end in accordance with the Charter, as provided for in
paragraph 4 of resolution 687 (1991);

5. Welcomes further the Secretary-Generalâ€™s intention to carry out at
the earliest practicable time the realignment of the demilitarized zone
referred to in paragraph 5 of resolution 687 (1991) to correspond to the
international boundary demarcated by the Commission, with the consequent
removal of the Iraqi police posts;

6. Urges the two States concerned to cooperate fully with the work of
the Commission;

7. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
