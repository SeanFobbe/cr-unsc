Resolution 662 (1990)
of 9 August 1990

The Security Council,

Recalling its resolutions 660 (1990) of 2 August 1990
and 661 (1990) of 6 August 1990,

Gravely alarmed by the declaration by Iraq of a “comprehensive and eternal merger” with Kuwait,

Demanding once again that Iraq withdraw immediately
and unconditionally all its forces to the positions in which
they were located on 1 August 1990,

Determined to bring the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq
to an end and to restore the sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity of Kuwait,

Determined also to restore the authority of the legitimate
Government of Kuwait,

1. Decides that annexation of Kuwait by Iraq under any
form and whatever pretext has no legal validity, and is
considered null and void;

2. Calls upon all States, international organizations
and specialized agencies not to recognize that annexation,
and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be
interpreted as an indirect recognition of the annexation;

3. Demands that Iraq rescind its actions purporting to
annex Kuwait;

4. Decides to keep this item on its agenda and to
continue its efforts to put an early end to the occupation.

Adopted unanimously at the
2934th meeting.
