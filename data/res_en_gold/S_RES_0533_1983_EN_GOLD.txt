Resolution 533 (1983)
of 7 June 1983

The Security Council,

Having considered the question of the death sentences passed on 6 August 1982 in South Africa on
Mr. Thelle Simon Mogoerane, Mr. Jerry Semano Mosololi and Mr. Marcus Thabo Motaung, members
of the African National Congress of South Africa,

Recalling its statement of 4 October 1982 52 as well
as its resolution 525 (1982) appealing for executive
clemency in this case,

Gravely concerned over the decision of the South
African authorities on 6 June 1983 to refuse executive
clemency in respect of the three men,

Conscious that the carrying out of the death sentences will aggravate the situation in South Africa,

1. Calls upon the South African authorities to
commute the death sentences imposed on the three
men;

2. Urges all States and organizations to use their
influence and to take urgent measures, in conformity
with the Charter of the United Nations, the resolutions of the Security Council and relevant international
instruments, to save the lives of the three men.

Adopted unanimously at the
2452nd meeting.
