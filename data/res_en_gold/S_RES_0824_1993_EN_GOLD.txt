RESOLUTION 824 (1993)

Adopted by the Security Council at its
3208th meeting, on 6 May 1993


The Security Council,

Reaffirming all its earlier relevant resolutions,

Reaffirming also the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political
independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Having considered the report of the Mission of the Security Council to the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (S/25700) authorized by resolution
819 (1993), and in particular, its recommendations that the concept of safe
areas be extended to other towns in need of safety,

Reaffirming again its condemnation of all violations of international
humanitarian law, in particular, ethnic cleansing and all practices conducive
thereto, as well as the denial or the obstruction of access of civilians to
humanitarian aid and services such as medical assistance and basic utilities,

Taking into consideration the urgent security and humanitarian needs faced
by several towns in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as exacerbated by the
constant influx of large numbers of displaced persons including, in particular,
the sick and wounded,

Taking also into consideration the formal request submitted by the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina (S/25718),

Deeply concerned at the continuing armed hostilities by Bosnian Serb
paramilitary units against several towns in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and determined to ensure peace and stability throughout the country,
most immediately in the towns of Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac, as well
as Srebrenica,

Convinced that the threatened towns and their surroundings should be
treated as safe areas, free from armed attacks and from any other hostile acts
which endanger the well-being and the safety of their inhabitants,

Aware in this context of the unique character of the city of Sarajevo, as a
multicultural, multi-ethnic and pluri-religious centre which exemplifies the
viability of coexistence and interrelations between all the communities of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and of the need to preserve it and avoid its
further destruction,

Affirming that nothing in the present resolution should be construed as
contradicting or in any way departing from the spirit or the letter of the peace
plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Convinced that treating the towns referred to above as safe areas will
contribute to the early implementation of the peace plan,

Convinced also that further steps must be taken as necessary to achieve the
security of all such safe areas,

Recalling the provisions of resolution 815 (1993) on the mandate of
UNPROFOR and in that context acting under Chapter VII of the Charter,

1. Welcomes the report of the Mission of the Security Council established
pursuant to resolution 819 (1993), and in particular its recommendations
concerning safe areas;

2. Demands that any taking of territory by force cease immediately;

3. Declares that the capital city of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Sarajevo, and other such threatened areas, in particular the towns
of Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac, as well as Srebrenica, and their surroundings
should be treated as safe areas by all the parties concerned and should be free
from armed attacks and from any other hostile act;

4. Further declares that in these safe areas the following should be
observed:

(a) The immediate cessation of armed attacks or any hostile act against
these safe areas, and the withdrawal of all Bosnian Serb military or
paramilitary units from these towns to a distance wherefrom they cease to
constitute a menace to their security and that of their inhabitants to be
monitored by United Nations military observers;

(b) Full respect by all parties of the rights of the United Nations
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the international humanitarian agencies to free
and unimpeded access to all safe-areas in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
and full respect for the safety of the personnel engaged in these operations;

5. Demands to that end that all parties and others concerned cooperate
fully with UNPROFOR and take any necessary measures to respect these safe areas;

6. Requests the Secretary-General to take appropriate measures with a
view to monitoring the humanitarian situation in the safe areas and to that end,
authorizes the strengthening of UNPROFOR by an additional 50 United Nations
military observers, together with related equipment and logistical support; and
in this connection, also demands that all parties and all others concerned
cooperate fully and promptly with UNPROFOR;

7. Declares its readiness, in the event of the failure by any party to
comply with the present resolution, to consider immediately the adoption of any
additional measures necessary with a view to its full implementation, including
to ensure respect for the safety of United Nations personnel;

8. Declares also that arrangements pursuant to the present resolution
shall remain in force up until the provisions for the cessation of hostilities,
separation of forces and supervision of heavy weaponry as envisaged in the peace
plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are implemented;
