Resolution 554 (1984)
of 17 August 1984

The Security Council,

Recalling its resolution 473 (1980) and General
Assembly resolution 38/11 of 15 November 1983, as
well as other relevant United Nations resolutions
calling upon the authorities in South Africa to abandon
apartheid, end oppression and repression of the
black majority and seek a peaceful, just and lasting
solution in accordance with the principles of the
Charter of the United Nations and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

Convinced that the so-called "new constitution”
endorsed on 2 November 1983 by the exclusively
white electorate in South Africa would continue the
process of denationalization of the indigenous African
majority, depriving it of all fundamental rights, and
further entrench apartheid, transforming South Africa
into a country for "whites only”,

Aware that the inclusion in the "new constitution”
of the so-called "coloured" people and people of Asian
origin is aimed at dividing the unity of the oppressed
people of South Africa and fomenting internal conflict,

Noting with grave concern that one of the objectives of the so-called "constitution" of the racist
régime is to make the "coloured" people and people
of Asian origin in South Africa eligible for conscription
into the armed forces of the apartheid régime for
further internal repression and aggressive acts against
independent African States,

Welcoming the massive united resistance of the
oppressed people of South Africa against these "constitutional" manoeuvres,

Reaffirming the legitimacy of the struggle of the
oppressed people of South Africa for the elimination
of apartheid and for the establishment of a society in
which all the people of South Africa as a whole, irrespective of race, colour, sex or creed, will enjoy
equal and full political and other rights and participate
freely in the determination of their destiny,

Firmly convinced that the so-called "elections” to
be organized by the Pretoria régime in the current
month of August for the "coloured" people and
people of Asian origin and the implementation of this
"new constitution" will inevitably aggravate tension
in South Africa and in southern Africa as a whole,

1. Declares that the so-called "new constitution”
is contrary to the principles of the Charter of the
United Nations, that the results of the referendum of
2 November 1983 are of no validity whatsoever and
that the enforcement of the "new constitution" will
further aggravate the already explosive situation
prevailing inside apartheid South Africa:

2. Strongly rejects and declares as null and void
the so-called "new constitution" and the "elections”
to be organized in the current month of August for
the “coloured" people and people of Asian origin as
well as all insidious manoeuvres by the racist minority
régime of South Africa further to entrench white
minority rule and apartheid;

3. Further rejects any so-called "negotiated
settlement" based on bantustan structures or on the
so-called "new constitution";

4. Solemnly declares that only the total eradication of apartheid and the establishment of a non-racial
democratic society based on majority rule, through
the full and free exercise of universal adult suffrage
by all the people in a united and unfragmented South
Africa, can lead to a just and lasting solution of the
explosive situation in South Africa;
5. Urges all Governments and organizations not
to accord recognition to the results of the so-called
"elections" and to take appropriate action, in co-operation with the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity and in accordance with the
present resolution, to assist the oppressed people of
South Africa in their legitimate struggle for a non-racial, democratic society;

6. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the
Security Council on the implementation of the present
resolution;

7. Decides to remain seized of the matter.

Adopted at the 2551st meeting
by 13 votes to none, with
2 abstentions (United Kingdom of Great Britain’ and
Northern Ireland, United States of America).
