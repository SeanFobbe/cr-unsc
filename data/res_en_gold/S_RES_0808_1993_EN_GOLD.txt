RESOLUTION 808 (1993)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3175th meeting,
on 22 February 1993

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 713 (1991) of 25 September 1991 and all
subsequent relevant resolutions,

Recalling paragraph 10 of its resolution 764 (1992) of 13 July 1992, in
which it reaffirmed that all parties are bound to comply with the obligations
under international humanitarian law and in particular the Geneva Conventions
of 12 August 1949, and that persons who commit or order the commission of
grave breaches of the Conventions are individually responsible in respect of
such breaches,

Recalling also its resolution 771 (1992) of 13 August 1992, in which,
inter alia, it demanded that all parties and others concerned in the former
Yugoslavia, and all military forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, immediately
cease and desist from all breaches of international humanitarian law,

Recalling further its resolution 780 (1992) of 6 October 1992, in which
it requested the Secretary-General to establish, as a matter of urgency, an
impartial Commission of Experts to examine and analyse the information
submitted pursuant to resolutions 771 (1992) and 780 (1992), together with
such further information as the Commission of Experts may obtain, with a view
to providing the Secretary-General with its conclusions on the evidence of
grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and other violations of international
humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia,

Having considered the interim report of the Commission of Experts
established by resolution 780 (1992) (S/25274), in which the Commission
observed that a decision to establish an ad hoc international tribunal in
relation to events in the territory of the former Yugoslavia would be
consistent with the direction of its work,

Expressing once again its grave alarm at continuing reports of widespread
violations of international humanitarian law occurring within the territory of
the former Yugoslavia, including reports of mass killings and the continuance
of the practice of "ethnic cleansing",

Determining that this situation constitutes a threat to international
peace and security,

Determined to put an end to such crimes and to take effective measures to
bring to justice the persons who are responsible for them,

Convinced that in the particular circumstances of the former Yugoslavia
the establishment of an international tribunal would enable this aim to be
achieved and would contribute to the restoration and maintenance of peace,

Noting in this regard the recommendation by the Co-Chairmen of the
Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia
for the establishment of such a tribunal (S/25221),

Noting also with grave concern the â€œreport of the European Community
investigative mission into the treatment of Muslim women in the former
Yugoslavia" ($/25240, annex I),

Noting further the report of the committee of jurists submitted by France
(S/25266), the report of the commission of jurists submitted by Italy
(S/25300), and the report transmitted by the Permanent Representative of
Sweden on behalf of the Chairman-in-Office of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) (8/25307),

1. Decides that an international tribunal shall be established for the
prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international
humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since
1991;

2. Requests the Secretary-General to submit for consideration by the
Council at the earliest possible date, and if possible no later than 60 days
after the adoption of the present resolution, a report on all aspects of this
matter, including specific proposals and where appropriate options for the
effective and expeditious implementation of the decision contained in
paragraph 1 above, taking into account suggestions put forward in this regard
by Member States;

3. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
