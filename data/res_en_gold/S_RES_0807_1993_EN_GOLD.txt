RESOLUTION 807 (1993)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3174th meeting,
on 19 February 1993


The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 743 (1992) and all subsequent resolutions
relating to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR),

Having considered the report of the Secretary-General dated
10 February 1993 (S/25264 and Corr.1),

Deeply concerned by the lack of cooperation of the parties and others
concerned in implementing the United Nations peace- keeping plan in Croatia
(S/23280, Annex III),

Deeply concerned also by the recent and repeated violations by the
parties and others concerned of their cease-fire obligations,

Determining that the situation thus created constitutes a threat to peace
and security in the region,

Taking note in that context of the Secretary-General's request to the
Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia, mentioned in his report (S/25264 and Corr.1), to establish
as soon as possible, through discussions with the parties, a basis on which
UNPROFOR's mandate could be renewed,

Determined to ensure the security of UNPROFOR and to this end, acting
under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Demands that the parties and others concerned comply fully with the
United Nations peace-keeping plan in Croatia and with the other commitments
they have undertaken and in particular with their cease-fire obligations;

2. Demands further that the parties and others concerned refrain from
positioning their forces in the proximity of UNPROFOR's units in the United Nations
Protected Areas (UNPAs) and in the pink zones;

3. Demands also the full and strict observance of all relevant Security
Council resolutions relating to the mandate and operations of UNPROFOR in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina;

4. Demands also that the parties and others concerned respect fully
UNPROFOR's unimpeded freedom of movement enabling it inter alia to carry out all
necessary concentrations and deployments, all movements of equipment and weapons
and all humanitarian and logistical activities;

5. Decides, in the context of these demands, to extend UNPROFOR's mandate
for an interim period terminating on 31 March 1993;

6. Urges the parties and others concerned fully to cooperate with the
Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia in the discussions under their auspices in order to ensure full
implementation of the United Nations peace-keeping mandate in Croatia, including
inter alia through the collection and supervision of heavy weapons by UNPROFOR and
the appropriate withdrawal of forces:

7. Invites the Secretary-General to work to achieve the rapid implementation
of the United Nations peace-keeping mandate and of relevant Security Council
resolutions, including resolution 802 (1993), thus to ensure security and stability
throughout the UNPAs and the pink zones;

8. Invites further the Secretary-General, during the interim period and in
consultation with the force-contributing States, to take, in accordance with
paragraph 17 of his report, all appropriate measures to strengthen the security of
UNPROFOR, in particular by providing it with the necessary defensive means, and to
Study the possibility of carrying out such local redeployment of military units as
is required to ensure their protection;

9. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on the further
extension of UNPROFOR's mandate, including financial estimates for all UNPROFOR's
activities as proposed in his report of 10 February 1993 (S/25264 and Corr.1);

10. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
