RESOLUTION 838 (1993)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3234th meeting,
on 10 June 1993
 

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 713 (1991) of 25 September 1991 and all
subsequent relevant resolutions,

Reaffirming the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political
independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the responsibility of
the Security Council in this regard,

Reiterating the demands in its resolution 752 (1992) and subsequent
relevant resolutions that all forms of interference from outside the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina cease immediately and that its neighbours take swift
action to end all interference and respect its territorial integrity,

Recalling the demand in its resolution 819 (1993) that the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) immediately cease the supply of military
arms, equipment and services to Bosnian Serb paramilitary units,

Taking into account the report of the Secretary-General dated
21 December 1992 (S/25000) on the possible deployment of observers on the
borders of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Expressing its condemnation of all activities carried out in violation of
resolutions 757 (1992), 787 (1992) and 820 (1993) between the territory of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the United Nations
Protected Areas in the Republic of Croatia and those areas of the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces,

Considering that, in order to facilitate the implementation of the relevant
Security Council resolutions, observers should be deployed on the borders of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as indicated in its resolution 787 (1992),

Taking note of the earlier preparedness of the authorities in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to stop all but humanitarian
supplies to the Bosnian Serb party, and urging full implementation of that
commitment,

Considering that all appropriate measures should be undertaken to achieve a
peaceful settlement of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
provided for in the Vance-Owen Peace Plan,

Bearing in mind paragraph 4 (a) of its resolution 757 (1992) concerning the
prevention by all States of imports into their territories of all commodities
and products originating in or exported from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) and paragraph 12 of its resolution 820 (1993) concerning
import to, export from and transshipment through those areas of the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces,

1. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the Council as soon as
possible a further report on options for the deployment of international
observers to monitor effectively the implementation of the relevant Security
Council resolutions, to be drawn from the United Nations and, if appropriate,
from Member States acting nationally or through regional organizations and
arrangements, on the borders of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, giving
priority to the border between the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and taking into account
developments since his report of 21 December 1992 as well as the differing
circumstances affecting the various sectors of the borders and the need for
appropriate coordination mechanisms;

2. Invites the Secretary-General to contact immediately Member States,
nationally or through regional organizations or arrangements, to ensure the
availability to him on a continuing basis of any relevant material derived from
aerial surveillance and to report thereon to the Security Council;

3. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
