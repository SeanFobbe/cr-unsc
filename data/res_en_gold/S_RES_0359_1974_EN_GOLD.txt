The Security Council,

Noting with concern from the Secretary-Generalâ€™s
report on developments in Cyprus, 26 in particular documents S/11353/Add.24 and 25, that casualties are in-
creasing among the personnel of the United Nations

Cyprus, Turkey and Grcece,

Bearing in mind that the Secretary-General was requested by the Security Council in resolution 355

of the Council in which he dealt with the role, functions
and strength of the Force and related issues arising out

refrain from any action which might endanger the lives
and safety of its members;

3. Urges the parties concerned to demonstrate in a
firm, clear and unequivocal manner their willingness to
fulfil the commitments they have entered into in this
regard;

4, Demands further that a!) parties co-operate with
the United Nations Force in carrying out its tasks, including humanitarian functions, in all areas of Cyprus
and in regard to all sections of the population of Cyprus;

5. Emphasizes the fundamental principle that the
status and safety of the members of the United Nations
