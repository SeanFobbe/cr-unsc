resolutions, in particular resolution 541 (1983),

Gravely concerned about the further secessionist
acts in the occupied part of the Republic of Cyprus
which are in violation of resolution 541 (1983), namely,
the purported exchange of ambassadors between
Turkey and the legally invalid "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" and the contemplated holding of a
"constitutional referendum" and "elections", as well
as by other actions or threats of actions aimed at
further consolidating the purported independent State
and the division of Cyprus,
Deeply concerned about recent threats for settlement
of Varosha by people other than its inhabitants,

Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus,

1. Reaffirms its resolution 541 (1983) and calls for

of Northern Cyprus" set up by secessionist acts and

independence, territorial integrity, unity and non-
alignment of the Republic of Cyprus;

541 (1983);

and the present resolution;
