RESOLUTION 817 (1993)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3196th meeting,
on 7 April 1993

 

The Security Council,

Having examined the application for admission to the United Nations in
document S/25147,

Noting that the applicant fulfils the criteria for membership in the
United Nations laid down in Article 4 of the Charter,

Noting however that a difference has arisen over the name of the State,
which needs to be resolved in the interest of the maintenance of peaceful and
good-neighbourly relations in the region,

Welcoming the readiness of the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of
the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, at the request of the
Secretary-General, to use their good offices to settle the above-mentioned
difference, and to promote confidence-building measures among the parties,

Taking note of the contents of the letters contained in documents
8/25541, S/25542 and S/25543 received from the parties,

1. Urges the parties to continue to cooperate with the Co-Chairmen of
the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia in order to arrive at a speedy settlement of their difference;

2. Recommends to the General Assembly that the State whose application
is contained in document S/25147 be admitted to membership in the United
Nations, this State being provisionally referred to for all purposes within
the United Nations as "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" pending
settlement of the difference that has arisen over the name of the State;

3. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council on the
outcome of the initiative taken by the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee
of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.
