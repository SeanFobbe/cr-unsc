RESOLUTION 777 (1992)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3116th meeting
on 19 September 1992

 

 

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 713 (1991) of 25 September 1991 and all
subsequent relevant resolutions,

Considering that the state formerly known as the Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia has ceased to exist,

Recalling in particular resolution 757 (1992) which notes that "the claim
by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to continue
automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in the United Nations has not been generally accepted",

1. Considers that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations; and therefore
recommends to the General Assembly that it decide that the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United
Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly;

2. Decides to consider the matter again before the end of the main part
of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly.
