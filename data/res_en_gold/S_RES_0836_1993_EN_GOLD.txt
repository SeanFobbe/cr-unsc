RESOLUTION 836 (1993)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3228th meeting,
on 4 June 1993

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 713 (1991) of 25 September 1991 and all
subsequent relevant resolutions,

Reaffirming in particular its resolutions 819 (1993) of 16 April 1993 and
824 (1993) of 6 May 1993, which demanded that certain towns and their
surrounding areas in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be treated as
safe areas,

Reaffirming the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political
independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the responsibility of
the Security Council in this regard,

Condemning military attacks, and actions that do not respect the
sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, which, as a State Member of the United Nations, enjoys
the rights provided for in the Charter of the United Nations,

Reiterating its alarm at the grave and intolerable situation in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina arising from serious violations of
international humanitarian law,

Reaffirming once again that any taking of territory by force or any
practice of "ethnic cleansing" is unlawful and totally unacceptable,

Commending the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
Bosnian Croat party for having signed the Vance-Owen Plan,

Gravely concerned at the persistent refusal of the Bosnian Serb party to
accept the Vance-Owen Plan and calling upon that party to accept the Peace Plan
for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in full,

Deeply concerned by the continuing armed hostilities in the territory of
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina which run totally counter to the Peace
Plan,

Alarmed by the resulting plight of the civilian population in the territory
of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular in Sarajevo, Bihac,
Srebrenica, Gorazde, Tuzla and Zepa,

Condemning the obstruction, primarily by the Bosnian Serb party, of the
delivery of humanitarian assistance,

Determined to ensure the protection of the civilian population in safe
areas and to promote a lasting political solution,

Confirming the ban on military flights in the airspace of the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, established by resolutions 781 (1992) of 9 October 1992,
786 (1992) of 10 November 1992 and 816 (1993) of 31 March 1993,

Affirming that the concept of safe areas in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina as contained in resolutions 819 (1993) and 824 (1993) was adopted to
respond to an emergency situation, and noting that the concept proposed by
France in document S/25800 and by others could make a valuable contribution and
should not in any way be taken as an end in itself, but as a part of the Vance-Owen process and as a first step towards a just and lasting political solution,

Convinced that treating the towns and surrounding areas referred to above
as safe areas will contribute to the early implementation of that objective,

Stressing that the lasting solution to the conflict in the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina must be based on the following principles: immediate and
complete cessation of hostilities; withdrawal from territories seized by the use
of force and â€œethnic cleansing"; reversal of the consequences of "ethnic
cleansing" and recognition of the right of all refugees to return to their
homes; and respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political
independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Noting also the crucial work being done throughout the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina by the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), and the
importance of such work continuing,

Determining that the situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
continues to be a threat to international peace and security,

Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,

1. Calls for the full and immediate implementation of all its relevant
resolutions;

2. Commends the Peace Plan for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as
contained in document S/25479;

3. Reaffirms the unacceptability of the acquisition of territory by the
use of force and the need to restore the full sovereignty, territorial integrity
and political independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina;

4. Decides to ensure full respect for the safe areas referred to in
resolution 824 (1993);

5. Decides to extend to that end the mandate of UNPROFOR in order to
enable it, in the safe areas referred to in resolution 824 (1993), to deter
attacks against the safe areas, to monitor the cease-fire, to promote the
withdrawal of military or paramilitary units other than those of the Government
of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to occupy some key points on the
ground, in addition to participating in the delivery of humanitarian relief to
the population as provided for in resolution 776 (1992) of 14 September 1992;

6. Affirms that these safe areas are a temporary measure and that the
primary objective remains to reverse the consequences of the use of force and to
allow all persons displaced from their homes in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina to return to their homes in peace, beginning, inter alia, with the
prompt implementation of the provisions of the Vance-Owen Plan in areas where
those have been agreed by the parties directly concerned;

7. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation, inter alia, with the
Governments of the Member States contributing forces to UNPROFOR:

(a) To make the adjustments or reinforcement of UNPROFOR which might be
required by the implementation of the present resolution, and to consider
assigning UNPROFOR elements in support of the elements entrusted with protection
of safe areas, with the agreement of the Governments contributing forces;

(b) To direct the UNPROFOR Force Commander to redeploy to the extent
possible the forces under his command in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina;

8. Calls upon Member States to contribute forces, including logistic
support, to facilitate the implementation of the provisions regarding the safe
areas, expresses its gratitude to Member States already providing forces for
that purpose and invites the Secretary-General to seek additional contingents
from other Member States;

9. Authorizes UNPROFOR, in addition to the mandate defined in resolutions
770 (1992) of 13 August 1992 and 776 (1992), in carrying out the mandate defined
in paragraph 5 above, acting in self-defence, to take the necessary measures,
including the use of force, in reply to bombardments against the safe areas by
any of the parties or to armed incursion into them or in the event of any
deliberate obstruction in or around those areas to the freedom of movement of
UNPROFOR or of protected humanitarian convoys;

10. Decides that, notwithstanding paragraph 1 of resolution 816 (1993),
Member States, acting nationally or through regional organizations or
arrangements, may take, under the authority of the Security Council and subject
to close coordination with the Secretary-General and UNPROFOR, all necessary
measures, through the use of air power, in and around the safe areas in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to support UNPROFOR in the performance of
its mandate set out in paragraphs 5 and 9 above;

11. Requests the Member States concerned, the Secretary-General and
UNPROFOR to coordinate closely on the measures they are taking to implement
paragraph 10 above and to report to the Council through the Secretary-General;

12. Invites the Secretary-General to report to the Council, for decision,
if possible within seven days of the adoption of the present resolution, on the
modalities of its implementation, including its financial implications;

13. Further invites the Secretary-General to submit to the Council, not
later than two months after the adoption of the present resolution, a report on
the implementation of and compliance with the present resolution;


14. Emphasizes that it will keep open other options for new and tougher
measures, none of which is prejudged or excluded from consideration;

15. Decides to remain actively seized of the matter, and undertakes to
take prompt action, as required.
