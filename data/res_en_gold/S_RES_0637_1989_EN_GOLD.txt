Recognizing the important contribution of the Contadora Group and its Support Group in favour of peace
in Central America,

Welcoming the agreement on “Procedures for the
establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central
America” signed at Guatemala City on 7 August 1987
by the Presidents of the Republics of Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua 87 as the
manifestation of the will of the peoples of Central
America to achieve peace, democratization, reconciliation, development and justice, in accordance with their
decision to meet the historical challenge of forging a
peaceful destiny for the region,

Welcoming also the subsequent Joint Declarations
issued by the Central American Presidents on 16 January 1988 at Alajuela, Costa Rica 88 and on 14 February 1989 at Costa del Sol, El Salvador, 89

Aware of the importance which the Central American
Presidents attach to the role of international verification as an.essential component for the implementation
of the above-mentioned instruments, including, in particular, their commitments relating to regional security,
especially non-use of territory to support destabilization of neighbouring countries, and democratization, especially free and fair elections, as well as to the voluntary demobilization, repatriation or relocation of irregular forces, as agreed in the Costa del Sol accord of
14 February 1989,

Aware also that the commitments enshrined in the
Guatemala agreement 87 form a harmonious and indivisible whole,

Noting with appreciation the efforts undertaken to
date by the Secretary-General in support of the Central
American peace process, including his assistance in the
establishment of appropriate mechanisms to verify
compliance with the provisions of the Guatemala agreement and of the Joint Declaration adopted by the Central American Presidents at their meeting held in El
Salvador on 14 February 1989,® and particularly the
Secretary-General’s agreement with Nicaragua to deploy a United Nations observer mission to verify the
electoral process,

1. Commends the desire for peace expressed by the
Central American Presidents in signing on 7 August
1987 at Guatemala City the agreement on “Procedures

Central America” 87 and in the Joint Declarations sub-
sequently signed in pursuance of it;

2. Expresses its firmest support for the Guatemala
agreement and the Joint Declarations;

3. Calls upon the Presidents to continue their efforts to achieve a firm and lasting peace in Central
America through the faithful implementation of the

Joint Declaration of 14 February 1989;

4. Appeals to all States, in particular to those which
have links with the region and interests in it, to back the
political will of the Central American countries to com-
ply with the provisions of the Guatemala agreement and
of the Joint Declaration, particularly that regional and
extra-regional Governments which either openly or covertly supply aid to irregular forces or insurrectional
movements in the area immediately halt such aid, with
the exception of the humanitarian aid that contributes
to the goals of the Costa del Sol accord;

5. Lends its full support to the Secretary-General to
continue his mission of good offices, in consultation
with the Security Council, in support of the Central
American Governments in their effort to achieve the
goals set forth in the Guatemala agreement;
