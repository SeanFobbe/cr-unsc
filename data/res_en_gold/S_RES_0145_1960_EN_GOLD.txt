order in the Republic of the Congo would effectively
contribute to the maintenance of international peace
and security,

the admission of the Republic of the Congo to membership in the United Nations as a unit,

3. Commends the Secretary-General for the prompt
action he has taken to carry out resolution 143 (1960)
and for his first report;
