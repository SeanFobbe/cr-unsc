the State of Kuwait and the Republic of Iraq regarding the Restoration of
Friendly Relations, Recognition and Related Matters‚Äù signed by them on
4 October 1963, and that this task was carried out in the special circumstances

(S/22558),

basis for the cease-fire,

Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) to finalize the realignment of
