RESOLUTION 821 (1993)

Adopted by the Security Council at its 3204th meeting,
on 28 April 1993

The Security Council,

Reaffirming its resolution 713 (1991) of 25 September 1991 and all
subsequent relevant resolutions,

Considering that the State formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia has ceased to exist,

Recalling resolution 757 (1992) of 30 May 1992 which notes that "the claim
by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to continue
automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in the United Nations has not been generally accepted",

Recalling also its resolution 777 (1992) of 19 September 1992, in which it
recommended to the General Assembly that it decide that the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United
Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly,

Recalling further that the General Assembly by resolution 47/1 of
22 September 1992, having received the recommendation of the Security Council of
19 September 1992, considered that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia
and Montenegro) could not continue automatically the membership of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations; and therefore
decided that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should
apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in
the work of the General Assembly,

Recalling further that in its resolution 777 (1992) the Council decided to
consider the matter again before the end of the main part of the forty-seventh
session of the General Assembly, and that in December 1992 the members of the
Council agreed to keep the subject-matter of resolution 777 (1992) under
continuous review and to consider it again at a later date (S/24924),

1. Reaffirms that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations; and therefore recommends
to the General Assembly that, further to the decisions taken in resolution 47/1,
it decide that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) shall
not participate in the work of the Economic and Social Council;

2. Decides to consider the matter again before the end of the
forty-seventh session of the General Assembly.
