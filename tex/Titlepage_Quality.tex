\textbf{Digital Object Identifiers: Concept DOI and Version DOI}

This data set is uniquely identified via the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system. DOIs are persistent identifiers that are globally unique and can be resolved as a link by entering a DOI into the web service at \url{www.doi.org}. The DOI given in this document is a \emph{Version DOI}, which uniquely identifies version \version. Analysts who wish to enable replication analyses are strongly advised to cite the \emph{Version DOI} and the exact version of the data used. A \emph{Concept DOI} is available from the page of the Zenodo record under the heading \enquote{Cite all versions?} and will always resolve to the latest version.
